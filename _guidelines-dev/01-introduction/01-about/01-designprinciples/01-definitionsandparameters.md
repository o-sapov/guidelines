A music notation document is one that contains music notation; that is, any one of a number of "visual analogues of musical sound, either as a record of sound heard or imagined, or as a set of visual instructions for performers." (Ian D. Bent, et al. "Notation." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 25 May 2010. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/20114](http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/20114){:target='\_blank'}.) However, MEI's understanding is more inclusive than this restrictive definition, i.e. Braille certainly qualifies as music notation documents. 

The encoding scheme permits both the creation of new music notation documents and the conversion of existing ones from print and other electronic formats. However, conversion of existing documents may require revisions in content or rearrangement of information.
