The Music Encoding Initiative Community has given itself [By-laws](https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-by-laws.html){:target='\_blank'}, which regulate all essential properties and procedures. The community elects a [Board](https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-board.html){:target='\_blank'}, which in turn governs and represents the community. The Board consists of nine elected members, with three seats standing for election for three year terms each year. Everyone registered to the [MEI-L](https://music-encoding.org/community/community-contacts.html){:target='\_blank'} mailing list is eligible to vote for the Board.

In addition to the Board, there is a [Technical Team](https://music-encoding.org/community/technical-team.html){:target='\_blank'}, which is open for anyone interested to work on the maintenance and improvement of MEI itself. The Technical team will assist Interest Groups and other interested community members in an advisory capacity on how to further develop MEI for both existing and new fields of application.
