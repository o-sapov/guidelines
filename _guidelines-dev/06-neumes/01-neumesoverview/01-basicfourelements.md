The following four elements are the fundamental components of the Neumes Module:

{% include desc elem="syllable" %}

Neume notation can be thought of as "neumed text". Therefore, the syllable element provides high-level organization in this repertoire.

{% include desc elem="syl" %}

(syllable) â€“ Individual lyric syllable.
{% include figure img="modules/neumes/syllable.png" %}

{% include desc elem="neume" %}
Sign representing one or more musical pitches. As such, a {% include link elem="neume" %} consists of one or more {% include link elem="nc" %} element(s): 

| Connected | Non-connected | 
|:---------:|:---------:|
|  ![Connected](/guidelines/images/v4/modules/neumes/NEUME-con.png)  |  ![Non-connected](/guidelines/images/v4/modules/neumes/NEUME-non-con.png)  |

{% include desc elem="nc" %}

Sign representing a single pitched event, although the exact pitch may not be known. Examples of neume components are:

<style>table {width:100%;}</style>
