The following example illustrates the MEI encoding of the opening of Hildegarde’s “O Splendidissima Gemma” with the text “O splendidissima”. This example provides the basic MEI skeleton to have a valid MEI file and it may be used for reference for scholars willing to start encoding early music (and its text) in MEI. Information about the {% include link elem="staff" %} has been omitted for brevity, but it was originally encoded on a 5-line staff with two clefs, a “C” and a “F” on lines 5 and 3, respectively.
