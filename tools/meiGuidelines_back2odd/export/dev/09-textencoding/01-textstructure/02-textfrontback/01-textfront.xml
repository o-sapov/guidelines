<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">By ‘front matter’ these Guidelines mean distinct sections of a text (usually, but not necessarily, a printed one), prefixed to it by way of introduction or identification as a part of its production. Features such as title pages or prefaces are clear examples; a less definite case might be the prologue attached to a dramatic work. The front matter of an encoded text should not be confused with the MEI header described in chapter <ptr target="header"/>, which provides metadata for the entire file. An encoder may choose simply to ignore the front matter in a text, if the original presentation of the work is of no interest. No specific tags are provided for the various kinds of subdivision which may appear within front matter: instead, generic <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> (“division”) elements may be used, which should not be confused with <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> (“musical division”) elements. The following suggested values for the<hi rend="bold">@type</hi>attribute may be used to distinguish various kinds of division characteristic of front matter: {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">'preface'</hi>: A foreword or preface addressed to the reader in which the author or publisher explains the content, purpose, or origin of the text. {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">'ack'</hi>: A formal declaration of acknowledgement by the author in which persons and institutions are thanked for their part in the creation of a text. {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">'dedication'</hi>: A formal offering or dedication of a text to one or more persons or institutions by the author. {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">'abstract'</hi>: A summary of the content of a text as continuous prose. {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">'contents'</hi>: A table of contents, specifying the structure of a work and listing its constituents. The list element should be used to mark its structure. {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">'frontispiece'</hi>: A pictorial frontispiece, possibly including some text. The following extended example demonstrates how various parts of the front matter of a text may be encoded. The front part begins with a title page, which is presented in section <ptr target="textTitlePages"/>, below. This is followed by a dedication and a preface, each of which is encoded as a distinct div:  The front matter concludes with another <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> element, shown in the next example, this time containing a table of contents, which contains a <gi scheme="MEI">list</gi> element (as described in chapter <ptr target="textLists"/>). Note the use of the <gi scheme="MEI">ptr</gi> element to provide page-references: the implication here is that the target identifiers (song1, song2, etc.) will correspond with identifiers used for the <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> elements containing the individual songs. (For a description of the <gi scheme="MEI">ptr</gi> element, see chapter <ptr target="ptrRef"/>.)  Alternatively, the pointers in the table of contents might link to the page breaks at which a song begins, assuming that these have been included in the markup: </p>
