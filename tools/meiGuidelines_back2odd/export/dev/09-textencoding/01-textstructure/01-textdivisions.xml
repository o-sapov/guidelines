<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Text can be organized in different parts, for example in chapters or sections. The <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> element is used to encode such structural divisions. <specList>
      <specDesc key="div"/>
   </specList> For example, printed scores, before the actual notation, can have text that can be organized in multiple sections (e.g. a preface, a critical report, performance instructions, etc. for which see the following sections); each of these sections should be identified by a different <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> element. Text might also occur in between music sections (see <ptr target="sharedMdivContent"/>), for example in a collection of romantic piano works, a few pieces might be preceded or followed by poetry. Such text should be encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> element, as demonstrated in the following example:  Textual divisions may have titles or other forms of introductory material, which are encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">head</gi> element. <specList>
      <specDesc key="head"/>
   </specList> The following example shows the encoding of a preface translated into three different languages, each with a different heading:  Having said that <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> identifies any structural organization of text, it is often helpful to distinguish the typology of division. The<hi rend="bold">@type</hi>attribute can be used for this purpose. <specList>
      <specDesc key="div" atts="type"/>
   </specList>
   <hi rend="bold">@type</hi>may contain any number of space-separated<hi rend="italic">tags</hi>describing the nature of the <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> (or, in fact, any other element). The following example shows the use of<hi rend="bold">@type</hi>(in combination with<hi rend="bold">@n</hi>) to indicate three prefaces in English, German and Italian are columns on the same page. </p>
