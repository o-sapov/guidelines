<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Paragraphs are fundamental to prose text and typically group one or more sentences that form a logical passage. Usually, it is typographically distinct; that is, it usually begins on a new line and the first letter of the content is often indented, enlarged, or both. This element has a similar meaning as the corresponding elements in Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), and HTML. A paragraph is encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">p</gi> element: <specList>
      <specDesc key="p"/>
   </specList> Prose text is used for several different purposes within a MEI document, therefore <gi scheme="MEI">p</gi> can occur in many situations. For example, it may be used within metadata elements (see <ptr target="header"/>):  Alternatively, paragraphs may be part of the document contents (and therefore encoded within <gi scheme="MEI">music</gi>), either as <ptr target="textFrontBack"/> or within the music notation. In these cases, a paragraph will likely be contained by a <gi scheme="MEI">div</gi> or other elements containing prose (e.g. <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">figDesc</gi>, etc.). The following example shows a paragraph in a preface section: </p>
