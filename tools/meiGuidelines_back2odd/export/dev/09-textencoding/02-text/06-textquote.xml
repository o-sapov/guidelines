<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">It is common, in many types of texts, to find quotations. A quotation is typically attributed to another text other than the one being encoded. Often, the quoted material is typographically distinct from the surrounding text; i.e., surrounded by so-called ‘quote marks’ or rendered as a separate block of text. The <gi scheme="MEI">quote</gi> element is used to mark this function: <specList>
      <specDesc key="quote"/>
   </specList> The following examples show the use of <gi scheme="MEI">quote</gi>.  </p>
