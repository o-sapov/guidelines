<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> element indicates the location of an inline graphic, illustration, or figure. As noted above, there exists a wide variety of different graphics formats, and the following list is in no way exhaustive. Moreover, inclusion of any format in this list should not be taken as indicating endorsement by the MEI of this format or any products associated with it. Some of the formats listed here are proprietary to a greater or lesser extent and cannot therefore be regarded as standards in any meaningful sense. They are, however, widely used by many different vendors. The following formats are widely used at the present time, and are likely to remain supported by more than one vendor's software: - BMP: Microsoft bitmap format - CGM: Computer Graphics Metafile - GIF: Graphics Interchange Format - JPEG: Joint Photographic Expert Group - PBM: Portable Bit Map - PCX: IBM PC raster format - PICT: Macintosh drawing format - PNG: Portable Network Graphics format - Photo-CD: Kodak Photo Compact Disk format - QuickTime: Apple real-time image system - SMIL: Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language format - SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics format - TIFF: Tagged Image File Format Brief descriptions of all the above are given below. Where possible, current addresses or other contact information are shown for the originator of each format. Many formal standards, especially those promulgated by the ISO and many related national organizations (ANSI, DIN, BSI, and many more), are available from those national organizations. Addresses may be found in any standard organizational directory for the country in question.</p>
