This element is intended for use as an alternative to the content of its parent <gi scheme="MEI">fig</gi> element; for example, for display when the equipment in use cannot display graphic images. It may also be used for indexing or documentary purposes, in which case best practice suggests the use of controlled vocabulary terms.  Occasionally, a figure description may have a complex structure. In this case, one or more textual component elements (<gi scheme="MEI">p</gi> [paragraph], <gi scheme="MEI">table</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">list</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">quote</gi>, or <gi scheme="MEI">lg</gi> [linegroup]) may be used to model the internal structure of the description: </p>
