<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In some situations it is necessary to provide references from one bibliographic item to another. For these situations, MEI offers the <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> element. A <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> may be used inside of <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi>, and may either point to a different entity using its<hi rend="bold">@target</hi>attribute, or may hold the related item as a child.  In this example, the nested <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> / <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> provides information about the ‘container’ where the outer <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> may be found. The kind of relation is expressed using the<hi rend="bold">@rel</hi>attribute. It describes the relationship of the child <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> to the <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi>'s parent <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi>. <specList>
      <specDesc key="relatedItem" atts="rel"/>
   </specList> In these relations, the subject is always the relatedItem, and the object is always the parent of the relatedItem. Thus, a value of<hi rend="bold">@rel</hi>="preceding" indicates that the resource described within the relatedItem (or referenced by its<hi rend="bold">@target</hi>attribute) precedes the <gi scheme="MEI">bibl</gi> containing the <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi>. Following MODS, both values of "preceding" and "succeeding" indicate a temporal order. It is important not to confuse <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> with the concepts of <ptr target="FRBR"/>; see <ptr target="headerRelatedItemVsFRBR"/>.</p>
