<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">MIDI messages are encapsulated in the <gi scheme="MEI">midi</gi> element, which is typically used in contexts like <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>. In earlier versions of MEI, the <gi scheme="MEI">noteOn</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">noteOff</gi> elements were used to record MIDI note on/off events. The use of these elements is now discouraged in favor of using the <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> element directly. MIDI duration should be recorded using the<hi rend="bold">@dur.ges</hi>attribute, and MIDI pitch information should be recorded using the<hi rend="bold">@pnum</hi>attribute. MIDI control changes (<gi scheme="MEI">cc</gi>) are encoded using the<hi rend="bold">@num</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@val</hi>attributes. Control change numbers are specified in the General MIDI documentation. In the example below, the <gi scheme="MEI">cc</gi> elements encode increasing controller event 7 (volume) values, or in musical terms, a crescendo. Other MIDI event messages follow this same pattern, using the<hi rend="bold">@num</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@val</hi>attributes to record the raw MIDI data.  In the preceding example, each control change is associated with a time stamp. The<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>attribute is required in order to indicate when the MIDI event should take place. It is often necessary to indicate a time stamp slightly earlier than the affected notes to compensate for MIDI delay. For better legibility and error checking, the <gi scheme="MEI">midi</gi> element may be used, as in the following example, to group MIDI parameter changes. Even so, the<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>attribute is required on all parameters in order to associate them with their point of actuation: </p>
