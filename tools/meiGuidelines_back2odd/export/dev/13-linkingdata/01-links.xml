<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">An element is a ‘link’ when it has an attribute whose value is a reference to the ID of one or more other elements (cross-reference). These link elements indicate an association between themselves (or one of their ancestors) and one or more other entities, either inside the same document or elsewhere. An association between two elements in the same document is said to be an ‘internal’ link, while an association that involves an entity outside the current document is called an ‘external’ link. However, either of the elements discussed in the following section can be used for either purpose.</p>
