<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Within <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi>, each <gi scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> element may specify its dimensions using the following attributes: <specList>
      <specDesc key="att.height" atts="height"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="att.width" atts="width"/>
   </specList> The values of those attributes, however, specify the height and width of the digital resource, the scan of the source, and they are typically given in pixels (see <ptr target="facsimileElements"/>). In contrast, <gi scheme="MEI">folium</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">bifolium</gi> are supposed to provide the dimensions of the original source in cm or inches. This makes it possible to combine separate parts of a manuscripts stored in different libraries, which are scanned at different resolutions. In case of <gi scheme="MEI">bifolium</gi> elements, these dimensions apply to the<hi rend="italic">folded</hi>sheet. Some printed scholarly editions like the<hi rend="italic">Neue Bach-Ausgabe</hi>provide very detailed information about the sizes and binding of individual leaves of a manuscript; with <gi scheme="MEI">foliaDesc</gi> and its children it is possible to encode that information in processable ways, even without providing digitizations of the sources via <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi>.</p>
