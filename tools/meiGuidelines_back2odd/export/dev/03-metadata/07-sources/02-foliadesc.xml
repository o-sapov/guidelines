<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">While many other elements within <gi scheme="MEI">physDesc</gi> describe specific features of manuscripts and prints in prose, <gi scheme="MEI">foliaDesc</gi> is intended to be processable. It provides information about the binding of a manuscript or print and the layout of its pages. The most important elements used are: <specList>
      <specDesc key="foliaDesc"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="folium"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="bifolium"/>
   </specList> The nesting of <gi scheme="MEI">bifolium</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">folium</gi> elements reflects the nesting of paper sheets that make up the text block of the source. For instance, if a manuscript consists of two folded sheets of paper, with a single, unfolded sheet in the middle, this would be encoded with two nested <gi scheme="MEI">bifolium</gi> elements, where the inner one has an additional <gi scheme="MEI">folium</gi> element:  <figure>
      <head>Nesting of two bifolia and one folium</head>
      <graphic url="ExampleImages/foliadesc-01.png"/>
   </figure> Multiple signatures (groups of nested pages) bound together can be reflected by encoding a sequence of <gi scheme="MEI">bifolium</gi> elements (with their respective contents). If the binding of a source is unknown, but <gi scheme="MEI">foliaDesc</gi> is needed for other reasons, it is recommended to use a sequence of <gi scheme="MEI">folium</gi> elements only, with no indication of nesting at all.</p>
