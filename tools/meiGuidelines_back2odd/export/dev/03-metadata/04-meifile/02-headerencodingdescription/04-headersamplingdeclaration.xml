<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The samplingDecl element holds a prose description of the rationale and methods used in selecting texts, or parts of text, for inclusion in the resource. <specList>
      <specDesc key="samplingDecl"/>
   </specList> The <gi scheme="MEI">samplingDecl</gi> element should include information about such matters as: - the size of individual samples - the method or methods by which they were selected - the underlying population being sampled - the object of the sampling procedure used but is not restricted to these.  It may also include a simple description of any parts of the source text included or excluded:   A sampling declaration which applies to more than one text or division of a text need not be repeated in the header of each such text. Instead, the<hi rend="bold">@decls</hi>attribute of each text (or subdivision of the text) to which the sampling declaration applies may be used to supply a cross-reference to it, as further described in section <ptr target="headerAssociatingMetadataAndData"/>.</p>
