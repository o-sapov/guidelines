<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi scheme="MEI">notesStmt</gi> element is the sixth component of the <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element and is optional. If used, it contains one or more <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi> elements, each containing a single piece of descriptive information of the kind treated as ‘general notes’ in traditional bibliographic descriptions. <specList>
      <specDesc key="notesStmt"/>
   </specList> Some information found in the notes area in conventional bibliography has been assigned specific elements in these Guidelines; in particular the following items should be tagged as indicated, rather than as general notes: - the nature, scope, artistic form, or purpose of the work; also the genre or other intellectual category to which it may belong. These should be formally described within the <gi scheme="MEI">workList</gi> element (section <ptr target="headerWorkDescription"/>). - bibliographic details relating to the source or sources of an electronic text: e.g., ‘Transcribed from a facsimile of the 1743 publication’. These should be formally described in the <gi scheme="MEI">sourceDesc</gi> element (section <ptr target="headerSourceDescription"/>). - further information relating to publication, distribution, or release of the text, including sources from which the text may be obtained, any restrictions on its use or formal terms on its availability. These should be placed in the appropriate division of the <gi scheme="MEI">pubStmt</gi> element (section <ptr target="headerPublicationDistribution"/>). - publicly documented numbers associated<hi rend="italic">with the file</hi>should be placed in an <gi scheme="MEI">altId</gi> element within the <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> element. International Standard Serial Numbers (ISSN), International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN), and other internationally agreed upon standard numbers that uniquely identify an item, should be treated in the same way, rather than as specialized bibliographic notes. As described elsewhere, identifiers<hi rend="italic">for sources of the file</hi>should be recorded within the <gi scheme="MEI">sourceDesc</gi>. Nevertheless, the <gi scheme="MEI">notesStmt</gi> element may be used to record potentially significant details about the file and its features, for example: - dates, when they are relevant to the content or condition of the computer file: e.g. ‘manual dated 2010’, ‘file validated Apr 2011’ - names of persons or bodies connected with the technical production, administration, or consulting functions of the effort which produced the file, if these are not named in statements of responsibility in the title or edition statements of the file description: e.g. ‘Historical commentary provided by members of the Big Symphony Orchestra’ - availability of the file in an additional medium or information not already recorded about the availability of documentation: e.g. ‘User manual is loose-leaf in eleven paginated sections’ - language of work and abstract, if not encoded in the <gi scheme="MEI">langUsage</gi> element, e.g. ‘Text in English with stage directions in French and German’ Each such item of information may be tagged using the general-purpose <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi> element. Groups of annotations are contained within the <gi scheme="MEI">notesStmt</gi> element, as in the following example:  There are advantages, however, to encoding such information with more precise elements elsewhere in the MEI header, when such elements are available. For example, the notes above might be encoded as follows: </p>
