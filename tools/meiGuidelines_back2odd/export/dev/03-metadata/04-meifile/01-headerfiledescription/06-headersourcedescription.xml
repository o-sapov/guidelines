In MEI, <gi scheme="MEI">sourceDesc</gi> is a grouping element containing one or more <gi scheme="MEI">source</gi> elements, each of which records details of a source from which the computer file is derived. This might be a printed text or manuscript, another computer file, an audio or video recording, or a combination of these. An electronic file may also have no source, if what is being cataloged is an original text created in electronic form. <specList>
