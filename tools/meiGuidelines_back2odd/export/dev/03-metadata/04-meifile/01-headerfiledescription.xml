<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The structure of the bibliographic description of a machine-readable or digital musical text resembles that of a book, an article, or other kinds of textual objects. The file description element of the MEI header has therefore been closely modelled on existing standards in library cataloging; it should thus provide enough information to allow users to give standard bibliographic references to the electronic text, and to allow catalogers to catalog it. Bibliographic citations occurring elsewhere in the header, and in the text itself, are derived from the same model. The bibliographic description of an electronic musical text should be supplied by the mandatory <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element: <specList>
      <specDesc key="fileDesc"/>
   </specList> The <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element contains two mandatory and six optional elements, each of which is described in more detail below. These elements are listed below in the order in which they must occur within the <gi scheme="MEI">fileDesc</gi> element. <specList>
      <specDesc key="titleStmt"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="editionStmt"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="extent"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="pubStmt"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="seriesStmt"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="notesStmt"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="sourceDesc"/>
   </specList> A complete file description will resemble the following example: </p>
