<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">MEI header information may refer to different levels of description of the encoded work: Some information may apply the work in all its various forms and realizations, e.g., the name of its composer. Other information may describe a certain version of the work, or a source such as the printed first edition, or only a single copy of that source. Core MEI limits the header information to two such levels of description: work and source, respectively. However, when the FRBR module is available more detailed descriptions are possible. With certain limitations, mainly due to the musical nature of the works encoded in MEI, the FRBR module adapts the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) as recommended by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA)<a xmlns=""
      href="http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records"
      title="">[http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records</a>{:.link_ref}]. The IFLAâ€™s FRBR model distinguishes four levels of abstraction, or entities: {:.gloss} **Work<hi rend="bold">: FRBR defines a work as a "distinct intellectual or artistic creation", an abstract entity because there is no single material object one can point to as the work. {:.gloss}</hi>Expression<hi rend="bold">: An expression is defined as "the intellectual or artistic realization of a work in the form of [...] notation, sound, image, object, movement, etc., or any combination of such forms". Expressions are also abstract entities. {:.gloss}</hi>Manifestation<hi rend="bold">: A manifestation is defined as "the physical embodiment of an expression of a work", including, for instance, manuscripts, books, sound recordings, films, video recordings, CD-ROMs, multimedia kits, etc. The manifestation represents all the physical objects that bear the same characteristics, with respect to both intellectual content and physical form. {:.gloss}</hi>Item**: A single exemplar of a manifestation is called an item, e.g., a specific copy of a printed score. With manuscripts, item and manifestation levels are nearly identical. A manuscript may be regarded as a manifestation having only one item.</p>
