<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">MEI offers two related concepts for capturing relations between bibliographic items. The model of <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi>, as described in chapter <ptr target="sharedRelatedItemDesc"/> of these Guidelines, is derived from MODS v3.4 (see documentation<a xmlns=""
      href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-userguide-elements.html#relateditem"
      title="">here</a>{:.link<hi rend="italic">ref}). Its purpose in MEI is to encode bibliographic references between mostly "secondary" material, like reviews, articles, and so on. It may be used to provide cross-references between information encoded in different places of the header. However, <gi scheme="MEI">relatedItem</gi> is less ideal for describing the relations between works, differing versions of these works, the sources in which those versions are transmitted, and where applicable the individual copies of a print. For these situations, it is strongly recommended to use the <ptr target="FRBR"/> instead. This module is based on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, as<a xmlns=""
         href="http://www.ifla.org/publications/functional-requirements-for-bibliographic-records"
         title="">specified</a>{:.link</hi>ref} by the<a xmlns="" href="http://www.ifla.org" title="">IFLA</a>{:.link_ref}. It allows a much finer description of relationships between such "primary" entities. For compatibility reasons, both models should not be confused or mixed under any circumstances.</p>
