<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Each of the four MEI elements corresponding to FRBR entities may contain a list of constituent parts. All four entities utilize the same element: <specList>
      <specDesc key="componentList"/>
   </specList> However, the child elements of a component group must be the same type as the group's parent. This allows for a more detailed description than is possible using the core MEI <gi scheme="MEI">contents</gi> element. For example, a work elementâ€™s <gi scheme="MEI">componentList</gi> element can only contain <gi scheme="MEI">work</gi> elements, etc. In this way, the <gi scheme="MEI">componentList</gi> element may be employed to describe composite works, as in the example below:  This technique can also be applied when a single intellectual source is comprised of multiple physical parts. In the following example, the choral parts were published in four physically separate "signatures": </p>
