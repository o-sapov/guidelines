<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The following elements are provided to capture the history of a musical work: <specList>
      <specDesc key="creation"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="event"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="eventList"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="history"/>
   </specList> The <gi scheme="MEI">creation</gi> element is intended to contain a brief, machine-processable statement of the circumstances of the work's creation. Its content is limited to text and the <gi scheme="MEI">date</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">geogName</gi> elements. The <gi scheme="MEI">history</gi> element is a container for additional non-bibliographic details relating to a work. It may use the <gi scheme="MEI">eventList</gi> element to provide a list of key events in the creation and performance history of the work. The <gi scheme="MEI">eventList</gi> element is comprised of <gi scheme="MEI">event</gi> elements containing a brief description of the associated event, including dates and locations where the event took place. An event list may use the<hi rend="bold">@type</hi>attribute to distinguish between multiple event lists with different functions, such as a list of events in the compositional process and a list of performance dates. Event lists and other text components, such as paragraphs, tables, lists, and text divisions (<gi scheme="MEI">div</gi>) may be interleaved when an 'essay-like' work history is desired. The <gi scheme="MEI">event</gi> element permits either a text-centric or a data-centric model. The text-centric model is provided for prose descriptions, while the data-centric model accommodates event descriptions that consist of a collection of descriptive phrases. In the text-centric model, paragraphs, tables, and lists may be used. In the data-centric model, however, only certain phrase-level elements, may appear.</p>
