<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi scheme="MEI">perfResList</gi> element is used to capture the solo and ensemble instrumental and vocal resources of a composition. For example, a work for a standard ensemble may be indicated thus:  The detailed make-up of standard and non-standard ensembles may also be enumerated:  Where multiple instruments of the same kind are used, the<hi rend="bold">@count</hi>attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">perfRes</gi> may be used to encode the exact number of players called for.  Instrument or voice specifications may be grouped using the <gi scheme="MEI">perfResList</gi> element and a label assigned to the group with <gi scheme="MEI">head</gi>. For example:   The preceding example also demonstrates how instrumental doublings can be accommodate through the use of nested <gi scheme="MEI">perfRes</gi> elements. Only the outer-most perfRes element should use the<hi rend="bold">@count</hi>attribute. Its value should reflect the total number of performers, not the number of instruments played. The <gi scheme="MEI">perfRes</gi> element provides the<hi rend="bold">@codedval</hi>attribute, which can be used to record a coded value that represents the string value stored as the element's content. It is recommended that coded values be taken from a standardized list, such as the [International Association of Music Libraries' Medium of Performance Codes List](http://www.urfm.braidense.it/risorse/searchmedium<hi rend="italic">en.php){:.link</hi>ref} or the<a xmlns=""
      href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/marcmusperf.html"
      title="">MARC Instruments and Voices Code List</a>{:.link_ref}.  Solo parts may be marked with the **@solo<hi rend="bold">attribute of <gi scheme="MEI">perfRes</gi>, like so:  Music for a single player should, however, never use the</hi>@solo** attribute. </p>
