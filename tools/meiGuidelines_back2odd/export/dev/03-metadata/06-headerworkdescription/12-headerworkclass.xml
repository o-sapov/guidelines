<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Within <gi scheme="MEI">work</gi>, the <gi scheme="MEI">classification</gi> element is used to classify the work according to some classification scheme. More generally, <gi scheme="MEI">classification</gi> may be used to classifiy any FRBR entity (<gi scheme="MEI">work</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">expression</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">manifestation</gi>, or <gi scheme="MEI">item</gi>). The following elements are provided for this purpose: <specList>
      <specDesc key="termList"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="term"/>
   </specList> The <gi scheme="MEI">termList</gi> element categorizes the parent entity by supplying a set of terms which may describe its topic or subject matter, its physical or intellectual form, date, etc. Each term is indicated by a <gi scheme="MEI">term</gi> element. In some schemes, the order of items in the list is significant, for example, from major topic to minor; in others, the list has an organized substructure of its own. No recommendations are made here as to which method is to be preferred. Wherever possible, such terms should be taken from a recognized source. In its simplest form, the <gi scheme="MEI">term</gi> element just contains a descriptive keyword.  The<hi rend="bold">@class</hi>attribute may be used on each term element to make reference to a classification scheme (declared in the <gi scheme="MEI">classDecls</gi> element) from which it is drawn.  Alternatively,<hi rend="bold">@class</hi>may be used on <gi scheme="MEI">termList</gi> when all the contained terms come from the same source. </p>
