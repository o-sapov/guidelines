<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The term corpus may refer to any collection of musical data, although it is often reserved for collections which have been organized or collected with a particular end in view, generally to illustrate a particular characteristic of, or to demonstrate the variety found in, a group of related texts. The principal distinguishing characteristic of a corpus is that its components have been selected or structured according to some conscious set of design criteria. In MEI, a corpus is regarded as a composite text because, although each discrete document in a corpus clearly has a claim to be considered as a text in its own right, it is also regarded as a subdivision of some larger object, if only for convenience of analysis. In corpora, the component samples are clearly distinct texts, but the systematic collection, standardized preparation, and common markup of the corpus often make it useful to treat the entire corpus as a unit, too. Corpora share a number of characteristics with other types of composite texts, including anthologies and collections. Most notably, different components of composite texts may exhibit different structural properties, thus potentially requiring elements from different MEI modules. Aside from these high-level structural differences, and possibly differences of scale, the encoding of language corpora and the encoding of individual texts present identical sets of problems. Therefore, any of the encoding techniques and elements presented in other chapters of these Guidelines may therefore prove relevant to some aspect of corpus encoding and may be used in corpora.</p>
