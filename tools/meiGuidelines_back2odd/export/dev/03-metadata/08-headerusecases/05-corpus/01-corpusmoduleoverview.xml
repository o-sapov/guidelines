<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The meiCorpus module defines a single element: <specList>
      <specDesc key="meiCorpus"/>
   </specList> The <gi scheme="MEI">meiCorpus</gi> element is intended for the encoding of corpora, though it may also be useful in encoding any collection of disparate materials. The individual samples in the corpus are encoded as separate <gi scheme="MEI">mei</gi> elements, and the entire corpus is enclosed in an <gi scheme="MEI">meiCorpus</gi> element. Each sample has the usual structure for a <gi scheme="MEI">mei</gi> document, comprising an <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> followed by a <gi scheme="MEI">music</gi> element. The corpus, too, has a corpus-level <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> element, in which the corpus as a whole, and encoding practices common to multiple samples may be described. The overall structure of an MEI-conformant corpus is thus:  This two-level structure allows for metadata to be specified at the corpus level, at the individual text level, or at both. However, metadata which relates to the whole corpus rather than to its individual components should be removed from the individual component metadata and included only in the <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> element prefixed to the whole. In some cases, the design of a corpus is reflected in its internal structure. For example, a corpus of musical incipits might be arranged to combine all compositions of one type (symphonies, songs, chamber music, etc.) into some higher-level grouping, possibly with sub-groups for date of publication, instrumentation, key, etc. The <gi scheme="MEI">meiCorpus</gi> element provides no support for reflecting such internal structure in the markup: it treats the corpus as an undifferentiated series of components, each tagged with an <gi scheme="MEI">mei</gi> element. If it is essential to reflect the organization of a corpus into sub-components, then the members of the corpus should be encoded as composite texts instead, using the <gi scheme="MEI">group</gi> element described section <ptr target="sharedMusicElement"/>. The mechanisms for corpus characterization described in this chapter, however, are designed to reduce the need to do this. Useful groupings of components may easily be expressed using the classification and identification elements described in section <ptr target="headerWorkClass"/>, and those for associating declarations with corpus components described in section <ptr target="headerAssociatingMetadataAndData"/>. These mechanisms also allow several different methods of text grouping to co-exist, each to be used as needed at different times. This helps minimize the danger of cross-classification and mis-classification of samples, and helps improve the flexibility with which parts of a corpus may be characterized for different applications. All composite texts share the characteristic that their different component texts may be of structurally similar or dissimilar types. If all component texts may all be encoded using the same module, then no problem arises. If however they require different modules, then the various modules must all be included in the schema.</p>
