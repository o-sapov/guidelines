<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The following element is provided to accommodate non-MEI metadata: <specList>
      <specDesc key="extMeta"/>
   </specList> The <gi scheme="MEI">extMeta</gi> element may be contained by <gi scheme="MEI">expression</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">item</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">manifestation</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">work</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> elements. It may include text and any number of well-formed XML fragments, XML comments, and CDATA sections, except for MEI markup, which is prohibited. The document element of each fragment must explicitly declare its namespace.  An MEI processor is not required to validate or otherwise process any markup within the <gi scheme="MEI">extMeta</gi> element. Therefore, the <gi scheme="MEI">extMeta</gi> element itself is the lowest level at which an association can be created between ‘foreign’ metadata and other MEI elements as described in section <ptr target="headerAssociatingMetadataAndData"/>.</p>
