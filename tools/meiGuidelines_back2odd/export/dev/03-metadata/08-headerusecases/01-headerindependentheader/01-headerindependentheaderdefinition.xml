<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">An independent header is an MEI metadata header that can be exchanged as an independent document between libraries, archives, collections, projects, and individuals. The structure of an independent header is exactly the same as that of an header attached to a document. This means that an <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> can be extracted from an MEI document and sent to a receiving institution with little or no change. When deciding which information to include in the independent header, and the format or structure of that information, the following should be kept in mind: - The independent header should provide full bibliographic information about the encoded text, its sources, where the text can be located, and any restrictions governing its use. - The independent header should contain useful information about the encoding of the text itself. In this regard, it is highly recommended that the encoding description be as complete as possible. The Guidelines do not require that the encoding description be included in the header (since some simple transcriptions of small items may not require it), but in practice the use of a header without an encoding description would be severely limited. - The independent header should be amenable to automatic processing, particularly for loading into databases and for the creation of publications, indexes, and finding aids, without undue editorial intervention on the part of the receiving institution. For this reason, two recommendations are made regarding the format or structure of the header: first, where there is a choice between a prose content model and one that contains a formal series of specialized elements, wherever possible and appropriate the specialized elements should be preferred to unstructured prose. Second, with respect to corpora, information about each of the texts within a corpus should be included in the overall corpus-level <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi>. That is, source information, editorial practices, encoding descriptions, and the like should be included in the relevant sections of the corpus <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi>, with pointers to them from the headers of the individual texts included in the corpus. There are three reasons for this recommendation: first, the corpus-level header will contain the full array of bibliographic and documentary information for each of the texts in a corpus, and thus be of great benefit to remote users, who may have access only to the independent header; second, such a layout is easier for the coder to maintain than searching for information throughout a text; and third, generally speaking, this practice results in greater overall consistency, especially with respect to bibliographic citations.</p>
