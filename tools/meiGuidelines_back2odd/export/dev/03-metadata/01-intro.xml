<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Metadata means "data about data", i.e. information about various aspects of an encoding at hand. There are many different types of metadata, which MEI tries to order according to their respective scope or perspective, as described in <ptr target="headerstructure"/>. MEI's approach to metadata is heavily influenced by other existing standards and models, such as TEI, MARC, and FRBR. It attempts to reflect both current library practice and common scholarly methods, for example in the field of source descriptions (see chapter <ptr target="msdesc"/>). This chapter thus addresses the description of an encoded item so that the musical text, as well as its sources, encoding, and revisions are all thoroughly documented. Such documentation is necessary for scholars using the texts, for software processing them, and for catalogers in libraries and archives. Together these descriptions and declarations provide an electronic analog to the title page attached to a printed work. They also constitute an equivalent for the content of the code books or introductory manuals customarily accompanying electronic data sets.</p>
