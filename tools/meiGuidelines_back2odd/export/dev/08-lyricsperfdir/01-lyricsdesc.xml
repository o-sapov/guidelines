<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">These guidelines suggest two methods for encoding text in vocal notation: encoding syllables as <ptr target="lyricsInEvents"/> and encoding performed text as <ptr target="lyricsAfterEvents"/> after the notes (and other staff events) either within <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> elements or within <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> elements when available (for example in a Common Music Notation context). Each method may be more convenient depending on the source text and on the textual phenomena that the encoding intends to record. Both methods eventually rely on the <gi scheme="MEI">syl</gi> element, which is part of the ‘shared’ module and is therefore available in all MEI files. The following sections will begin by introducing the general use of <gi scheme="MEI">syl</gi> and then show in detail the two different encoding methods.</p>
