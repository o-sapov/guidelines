<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">MEI offers multiple ways of defining onsets and offsets of timed musical events such as notes and slurs. The most common and most musician-friendly approach to this is through the use of a combination of the attributes<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@dur</hi>, which are made available by the attribute classes <ident type="class">att.timestamp.logical</ident> (inherited by <ident type="class">att.controlEvent</ident>) and <ident type="class">att.timestamp2.logical</ident>, both from the shared module. The timestamp (<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>) of a musical event is calculated in relation to the meter of the current measure and resembles the so-called ‘beat’ position. In a common time measure with four quarter notes, the timestamp of each quarter equals its beat position in the measure: The first quarter has a timestamp of 1, the second has a timestamp of 2, and so on. MEI defines the value of<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>as a real number; the second eighth note position in a measure would thus be represented by the value of "1.5". The range of possible values is defined as starting with zero and ending with the number of metrical units in a measure (the ‘numerator’ in a time signature) + 1. This allows the capture of all graphical positions starting from the left barline ('0') and ending with the right barline of the measure ('5', in the case of 4/4 time). For expressing durations, MEI offers the<hi rend="bold">@dur</hi>attribute. This attribute is described in section <ptr target="cmnNotesBasic"/>. For ‘spanning’ elements like slurs, which are members of the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike</ident> class, it is often more intuitive to record two timestamps – one for the onset of the event and one for its termination. Because the termination of the event may be in a succeeding measure, the second timestamp (<hi rend="bold">@tstamp2</hi>) has a slightly different datatype than the one marking the initiation of the event. Its datatype is constrained to values following the formula "<hi rend="italic">xm + y</hi>", where<hi rend="italic">x</hi>is the number of full measures that this particular feature lasts (or the number of bar lines crossed) and<hi rend="italic">y</hi>is the timestamp in the target measure where the feature ends. The timestamp is expressed using the same logic as described above. For example, a value of "0m+3" in 4/4 time indicates that the element bearing this attribute, a slur for example, ends on beat 3 of the same measure where it started. A value of "1m+1.5" would indicate an end on the second eighth note of the following measure. In 6/8 time, the value "2m+3" means that the feature ends two measures later on the third eighth note.</p>
