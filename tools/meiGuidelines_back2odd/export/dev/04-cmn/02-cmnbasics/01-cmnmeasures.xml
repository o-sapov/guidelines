<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Arguably, the most important element of the CMN module is the <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> element. It is used as a structural unit inside <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> elements and acts as a container for ‘events’ from the <ident type="class">model.eventLike</ident> class, such as notes, chords and rests as well as ‘control events’ from the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike</ident> class, such as slurs and indications of dynamics. The following example demonstrates the use of the <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> element:  A <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> slices the flow of a score or part into chunks that normally comply with a duration determined by the meter defined within a preceding <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> element. Each staff in the source material is represented by a <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> element. As the order of the staff elements in the file does not have to reflect their order in the original document, to eliminate confusion they should always refer to a <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> element, using either an<hi rend="bold">@n</hi>or<hi rend="bold">@def</hi>attribute. Whereas the<hi rend="bold">@def</hi>attribute uses the xs:anyURI datatype, the<hi rend="bold">@n</hi>value refers to the closest preceding <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">layerDef</gi> with the same value in its<hi rend="bold">@n</hi>attribute.  Each <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> may hold a number of <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> elements to reflect multiple ‘voices’. Just as with <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi>, the order of the <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> elements in the file does not have to reflect their original order in the document, so they also possess<hi rend="bold">@n</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@def</hi>attributes for association with the appropriate layer definition.
