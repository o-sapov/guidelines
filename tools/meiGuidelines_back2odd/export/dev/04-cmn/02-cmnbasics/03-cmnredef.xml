<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sometimes it is necessary to provide the parameters of a score or a staff with new values. For example. a score may change keys, gain or lose staves, use different layout settings at any point, etc. Likewise, a staff may change its clef, gain or lose layers, or become invisible, and so on. To accommodate these circumstances, in CMN <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> is allowed to occur in the following locations: - within the description of staff groups; that is, in <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi>, - within the content of a <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>, - between measures; that is, directly within <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">ending</gi> elements, and - between sections and endings; that is, directly within a <gi scheme="MEI">score</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> element. In addition, <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> is allowed to occur: - within sections and endings; that is, inside <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">ending</gi> elements; and - between sections and endings; that is, directly within a <gi scheme="MEI">score</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi>. The possibility also exists to include <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> in staves and layers when the mei-all schema is in use; however, this practice is not recommended for the CMN repertoire.</p>
