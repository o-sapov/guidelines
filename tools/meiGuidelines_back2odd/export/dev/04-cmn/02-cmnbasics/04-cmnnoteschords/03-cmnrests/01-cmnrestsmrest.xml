<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi scheme="MEI">mRest</gi> (measure rest) element is used to indicate a complete measure rest, independent from the meter of the current <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>. The<hi rend="bold">@cutout</hi>attribute provides for the description of the rendition of the <gi scheme="MEI">mRest</gi>. If<hi rend="bold">@cutout</hi>is set to ‘cutout’ (the only value allowed), then the complete staff including the staff lines will not be rendered for this measure.  It is a semantic error to mix an <gi scheme="MEI">mRest</gi> with other events in the same <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi>. However, other ‘control events’, such as <gi scheme="MEI">fermata</gi>, may be used at the same time as <gi scheme="MEI">mRest</gi>.</p>
