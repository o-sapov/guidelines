<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The<hi rend="bold">@stem.mod</hi>attribute accommodates various stem modifiers found in the CMN repertoire. These symbols are placed on a note or chord's stem and generally indicate different types of tremolo and Sprechstimme. The following values are allowed: {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">1slash</hi>: 1 slash through stem {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">2slash</hi>: 2 slashes through stem {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">3slash</hi>: 3 slashes through stem {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">4slash</hi>: 4 slashes through stem {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">5slash</hi>: 5 slashes through stem {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">6slash</hi>: 6 slashes through stem {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">sprech</hi>: X placed on stem {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">z</hi>: Z placed on stem The<hi rend="bold">@stem.mod</hi>attibute is normally used in accordance with practices described in section <ptr target="cmnTrem"/>. The CMN module makes the <ident type="class">att.stems.cmn</ident> attribute class available, which adds the optional<hi rend="bold">@stem.with</hi>attribute to <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">chord</gi>. The attribute<hi rend="bold">@stem.with</hi>allows for the indication of a stem that joins notes on adjacent staves. <figure>

   </figure> The following code demonstrates one method of encoding the first chord in the last measure in the image above. The<hi rend="bold">@stem.with</hi>attribute must occur on all the notes or chords attached to the cross-staff stem.  Alternatively, the encoder may choose to treat the notes in the lower staff as logically belonging to the top staff and to ‘displace’ them using the<hi rend="bold">@staff</hi>attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi>. Some use cases, however, may require filling the time that those notes would normally occupy using the <gi scheme="MEI">space</gi> element described in section <ptr target="sharedNoteSpacing"/>. Using this mechanism, the example above could also be encoded like so:  The choice between these two methods of representing material that crosses staves is often software-dependent. Whereas<hi rend="bold">@stem.with</hi>can be used to define stems that connect notes across different staves (cross-staff chords)<hi rend="bold">@stem.sameas</hi>is meant for describing a stem that connects two notes pertaining to different layers within the same staff. The typical scenario for<hi rend="bold">@stem.sameas</hi>is orchestral scores where two wind instruments are notated on one single staff. Normally, the notes have individual stems pointing in opposite directions. However, it is common engraving practice that notes of the same duration are often stemmed together between the parts encoded in separate layers. The following example demonstrates this practice in the wind instruments (bassoons and trumpets in meas. 1 - 3, horns in meas. 3) {% include figure img="modules/cmn/K543<hi rend="italic">m1-3</hi>exc.png" caption="Shared stems" %} The following code represents an encoding of<hi rend="italic">shared stems</hi>in the basson and trumpet staff using<hi rend="bold">@stem.sameas</hi>. </p>
