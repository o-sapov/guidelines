<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">CMN ornaments that are not mordents, trills, or turns can be encoded with a generic <gi scheme="MEI">ornam</gi>. This element allows the encoder to represent ornaments as textual strings (e.g. with a Unicode symbol) or with a user defined symbol. Chromatic auxiliaries can be represented with<hi rend="bold">@accidlower</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@accidupper</hi>. The <gi scheme="MEI">ornam</gi> element can also be a control element. That is, it can be linked via its attributes to other events. The starting point of the directive may be indicated by either a tstamp, tstamp.ges, tstamp.real or startid attribute, while the ending point may be recorded by either a tstamp2, dur, dur.ges or endid attribute. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting point attribute. For example, Johann Sebastian Bach used non-standard ornaments in the<hi rend="italic">Klavierb端chlein f端r Wilhelm Friedemann Bach</hi>: <figure>
