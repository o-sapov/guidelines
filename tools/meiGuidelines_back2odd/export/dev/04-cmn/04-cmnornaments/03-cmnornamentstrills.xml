<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Trills are a type of ornament that consists of a rapid alternation of a note with one a semitone or tone above. A trill is encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">trill</gi> element and its attributes: <specList>
      <specDesc key="trill"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="att.ornamentAccid" atts="accidlower accidupper"/>
   </specList> Trills in modern notation are usually expressed with the abbreviation "tr" above a note on the staff. Often the abbreviation is followed by a wavy line that indicates the length of the trill. The following example demonstrates the encoding of simple trills: <figure>

   </figure>  It has been specified earlier that it is a semantic error not to encode a starting event or time stamp for an ornament. This starting point of a trill can be expressed with the **@startid<hi rend="bold">attribute and/or with the</hi>@tstamp<hi rend="bold">attribute. Specifying the end point is not required, although the</hi>@tstamp2<hi rend="bold">or</hi>@endid** attribute may be used to imply the use of a wavy line extender as shown in this example: <figure>

      <graphic url="modules/cmnOrnaments/ex_trill_wavy.png"/>
   </figure>  When giving an end point to trills, the **@extender<hi rend="bold">attribute should also be added, to indicate the presence or absence of a line extender. Notice, that the note referenced in</hi>@endid<hi rend="bold">is not part of the trill itself, just like in<a xmlns="" href="#cmnArpegGliss" title="">glissandos</a>. Chromatic alterations of auxiliary notes are occasionally expressed on the staff using small notes enclosed in parentheses, as shown in the example below. However, the attribute</hi>@accidupper** is still to be used to encode the alteration. Display of the auxiliary note in this ‘cautionary’ manner is left to down-stream rendering processes. <figure>

   </figure>  Some trills may be introduced by a turn or followed by an inverted turn leading to the next note (see Le garzantine, Musica 2003, p. 911). In such cases, the trill is encoded as in previous examples and associated with the principal note. Starting or concluding turns are notated on the staff (in <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi>) as <ptr target="cmnNotesGrace"/>. The following example, from a keyboard sonata by Joseph Haydn, shows a trill with concluding grace notes (called *Nachschlag*): {% include figure img="modules/cmnOrnaments/ex<hi rend="italic">tr</hi>grace.png" caption="Haydn, Sonata in D major, Hoboken XVI:33 (Wiener Urtex no. 34), mvmt. 1." %} </p>
