<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A mordent is an ornament that involves an auxiliary note a step above or below the principal note. The presence of a mordent is encoded with the <gi scheme="MEI">mordent</gi> element and its attributes: <specList>
      <specDesc key="mordent"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="att.mordent.log" atts="form long"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="att.ornamentAccid" atts="accidlower accidupper"/>
   </specList> It is recommended, but not required, to use the attribute<hi rend="bold">@form</hi>to encode the typology of mordents. Two common types are supported: those mordents that involve a note lower than the principal note, and those that involve a note higher than the principal note. The attribute<hi rend="bold">@form</hi>accepts the following values: {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">upper</hi>: usually corresponding to the symbol: . This mordent is commonly performed as the principal note, followed by its upper neighbor, with a return to the principal note. {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">lower</hi>: usually corresponding to the symbol: . This mordent is commonly performed as the principal note, followed by its lower neighbor, with a return to the principal note. The following example demonstrates the encoding of simple mordents: <figure>

   </figure>  Occasionally, mordents can be longer, employing five notes instead of three. The **@long** attribute can be used to identify mordents of this type. The following example shows the encoding of a long mordent: <figure>
