<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A very common feature of music notation from the CMN period is the so-called ‘fermata’ (or ‘corona’ in Italian). It is usually written as a dot above or below an arc. It may stand above or below the staff it affects with its ‘open’ side usually facing towards the staff. A fermata indicates that a related note or rest should be held longer than its written duration would normally require. Sometimes, a fermata occurs over or under a barline to indicate a pause or even the end of a phrase or section. <figure>

   </figure> In MEI, fermatas may be encoded using an attribute on elements like <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">chord</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">rest</gi>. This attribute allows placement of a fermata above or below the element to which it's attached. <figure>

   </figure>  However, if there is further (visual) information about the fermata that should be addressed in the encoding, MEI offers the <gi scheme="MEI">fermata</gi> element. This element, which is a member of the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike.cmn</ident> class and therefore requires the use of such attributes as<hi rend="bold">@staff</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@layer</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@startid</hi>, allows specification of the orientation of the fermata using its<hi rend="bold">@form</hi>attribute. In addition, the<hi rend="bold">@shape</hi>attribute may be used to indicate whether the fermata is rendered as the common semicircle  ("curved"), a semisquare  ("square"), or a triangle  ("angular"). If the fermata should be rendered using some other symbol, a user-defined symbol may be referred to using an<hi rend="bold">@altsym</hi>attribute or the<hi rend="bold">@glyph.name</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@glyph.num</hi>attributes respectively.  </p>
