<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A tempo or character indication is often provided above the topmost staff of the first measure of a score, movement, or section. This indication, such as "Allegro moderato" or "Andante maestoso", may be regarded as a label. Though it is possible to label the movement, etc. using a<hi rend="bold">@label</hi>attribute attached to the enclosing structural entity (that is, on <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi>), it is often required to capture the exact position, spelling, or other features of the label as found in the underlying source material. In these cases, an element is necessary. Labels which address the tempo at which the music should be performed should be encoded using the <gi scheme="MEI">tempo</gi> element, which is a specialized form of <gi scheme="MEI">dir</gi>. <gi scheme="MEI">tempo</gi> is a member of the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike</ident> class and as such occurs as a child of <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>, following all <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> children. Its<hi rend="bold">@staff</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@layer</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>attributes are used to ensure correct semantic positioning, and<hi rend="bold">@place</hi>indicates a visual position with respect to the staff. </p>
