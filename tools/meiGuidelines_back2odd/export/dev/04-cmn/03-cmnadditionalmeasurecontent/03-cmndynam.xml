<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Common Music Notation provides two different methodologies for expressing the volume of a note, phrase, section, etc. The first is a verbal instruction providing such information in human language, possibly in an abbreviated form. An example is the word<hi rend="italic">piano</hi>, indicating a quiet volume, often abbreviated as<hi rend="italic">p</hi>. In MEI, verbal instructions like this are encoded using the <gi scheme="MEI">dynam</gi> element from the Shared module (see chapter <ptr target="shared"/>):  By convention, <gi scheme="MEI">dynam</gi> elements, like <gi scheme="MEI">slur</gi> and other elements belonging to the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike</ident> class, are encoded at the end of the <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> to which they belong. This requires <gi scheme="MEI">dynam</gi> to be assigned to a certain <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> using the<hi rend="bold">@staff</hi>attribute, whose value refers to the target element's<hi rend="bold">@n</hi>attribute. In the absence of other information, all layers within the staff are assumed to have the same dynamic marking.  However, when the layers of a staff have different dynamic indications, the<hi rend="bold">@layer</hi>attribute may be used to associate a dynamic marking with a particular layer:  A suitable MIDI value may be assigned to a dynamic marking using the<hi rend="bold">@val</hi>attribute:  The location of a dynamic marking in relation to a staff may be specified using the<hi rend="bold">@place</hi>attribute, which may be given as<hi rend="italic">above</hi>,<hi rend="italic">within</hi>, or<hi rend="italic">below</hi>the staff:  Dynamics must also be associated with a particular time point in a measure, using the<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>, or with a particular event, using the<hi rend="bold">@startid</hi>attribute. Linking a control event with measures and events is discussed in section <ptr target="cmnTstamp"/>:  Dynamics which do not have an explicit endpoint are often referred to as ‘instantaneous’. On the other hand, some dynamic directions indicate a continuous change that must have a defined end point. It is possible to specify the logical scope of continuous dynamic marks using the attributes<hi rend="bold">@tstamp2</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@dur</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@dur.ges</hi>, or<hi rend="bold">@endid</hi>. Additionally a corresponding ending value for MIDI output may be given in the<hi rend="bold">@val2</hi>attribute. To capture the fact that the<hi rend="italic">crescendo</hi>in the example above continue until the first beat of the next measure, they may be marked:   Any combination of<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@startid</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@tstamp2</hi>, and<hi rend="bold">@endid</hi>attributes may be used to define the scope of a dynamic, although the<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@tstamp2</hi>or the<hi rend="bold">@startid</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@endid</hi>combinations are the most logical combinations. For example, the following alternatives are all possibilities for encoding up a crescendo. The choice of attributes is often task or processor dependent.   All musical elements affected by the <gi scheme="MEI">dynam</gi> may be explicitly specified using the<hi rend="bold">@plist</hi>attribute, which contains<hi rend="bold">@xml:id</hi>attribute value references:  It is recommended that the list of references in<hi rend="bold">@plist</hi>include all participants in the dynamic marking, including the first and last notes as in the preceding example, even though they are duplicated by<hi rend="bold">@startid</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@endid</hi>attributes. In addition to verbal instructions, Common Music Notation uses graphical symbols to indicate ‘continuous’ dynamics. These crescendo and decrescendo (or diminuendo) symbols are encoded in MEI using the <gi scheme="MEI">hairpin</gi> element. It also is a member of the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike</ident> class, which means it too is used just before the close of a <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> element, following the encoding of all staves. The required attribute<hi rend="bold">@form</hi>specifies the direction of the symbol by taking one of two possible values:<hi rend="italic">cres</hi>(growing louder) or<hi rend="italic">dim</hi>(getting softer).  Marking the logical extent of hairpins is possible using the same attributes as for <gi scheme="MEI">dynam</gi>.  The following example from [Béla Bartók's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Bart%C3%B3k) *Mikrokosmos*, Sz.107 shows a<hi rend="italic">diminuendo</hi>between two staves that begins on the first beat (in the current measure) and ends on the first one in the penultimate measure. The duration is highlighted with a dashed line, which can be indicated with the<hi rend="bold">@extender</hi>attribute. <figure>
