<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In CMN scores, there is often a large number of natural language instructions. Some of them concern the loudness and the speed of the performance, in which case MEI offers the elements <gi scheme="MEI">dynam</gi> (described at <ptr target="cmnDynam"/>) and <gi scheme="MEI">tempo</gi>. In other cases, however, they provide other instructions for the performer. Instead of providing separate elements for all possible types of such directions, MEI offers the generic <gi scheme="MEI">dir</gi> element. Although this element is not CMN specific (it is defined in <ptr target="shared"/>), it is frequently used in this repertoire.</p>
