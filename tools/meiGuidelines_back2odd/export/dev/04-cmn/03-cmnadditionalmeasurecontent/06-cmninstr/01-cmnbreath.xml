<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A breath mark indicates a point at which the performer of a wind instrument or singer may breathe. It is sometimes also used to indicate a short pause or break for instruments<hi rend="italic">not</hi>requiring breath, which allows it to also serve as a guide to phrasing. In MEI, breath marks are encoded using the <gi scheme="MEI">breath</gi> element, which is a member of <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike.cmn</ident>. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting point attribute.  The usual sign for the breath mark is a comma; however, other visual forms of the breath mark may be indicated using the<hi rend="bold">@altsym</hi>attribute (see chapter <ptr target="userSymbols"/> for further details).</p>
