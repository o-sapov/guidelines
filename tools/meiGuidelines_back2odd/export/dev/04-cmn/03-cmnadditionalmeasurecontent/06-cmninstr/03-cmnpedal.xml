<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Music for piano also often includes indications of the use of pedals. In MEI, these symbols are encoded using the <gi scheme="MEI">pedal</gi> element. As a member of the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike.cmn</ident> class, it is located within <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> and refers to a staff, layer and timestamp using the<hi rend="bold">@staff</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@layer</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>attributes. Alternatively, the<hi rend="bold">@startid</hi>attribute may be used to identify a <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">chord</gi> to which the mark should be assigned. The meaning of the mark is captured using the<hi rend="bold">@dir</hi>attribute, which provides the following values: {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">down</hi>: depress the pedal {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">up</hi>: release the pedal {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">bounce</hi>: release, then immediately depress the pedal again {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">half</hi>: depress the pedal half way  To specify the pedal, that has to be used, the<hi rend="bold">@func</hi>attribute allows the following values: {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">sustain</hi>: The sustain pedal, also referred to as the "damper" pedal, allows the piano strings to vibrate sympathetically with the struck strings. It is the right-most and the most frequently used pedal on modern pianos. (Often marked with: ) {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">soft</hi>: The soft pedal, sometimes called the "una corda", "piano", or "half-blow" pedal, reduces the volume and modifies the timbre of the piano. On the modern piano, it is the left-most pedal. {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">sostenuto</hi>: The sostenuto or tone-sustaining pedal allows notes already undamped to continue to ring while other notes are damped normally; that is, on their release by the fingers. This is usually the center pedal of the modern piano. (Often marked with: ) {:.gloss}<hi rend="bold">silent</hi>The silent or practice pedal mutes the volume of the piano so that one may practice quietly. It is sometimes a replacement for the sostenuto pedal, especially on an upright or vertical instrument.</p>
