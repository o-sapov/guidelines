<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Modern harps have seven pedals which allow adjustment of their strings to different pitches. The settings for these pedals occur at the beginning of the harp notation and/or whenever it is necessary to change the harp's tuning. These settings may be rendered using letter pitches (in the order of the pedals from left to right) or in a diagrammatic fashion, such as the form invented by [Carlos Salzedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Salzedo). In MEI, harp pedal settings are encoded using the <gi scheme="MEI">harpPedal</gi> element. It is a member of the <ident type="class">model.controlEventLike.cmn</ident> class and is therefore placed within <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>, following all <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> children. The **@staff<hi rend="bold">and</hi>@layer<hi rend="bold">attributes may be used to assign it to a certain <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi>. Either a</hi>@tstamp<hi rend="bold">or</hi>@startid<hi rend="bold">attribute must be used to indicate the placement within the measure (see <ptr target="cmnTstamp"/> and <ptr target="ptrRef"/> for further details about those linking mechanisms). The musical intention of the element is described using the</hi>@c<hi rend="bold">,</hi>@d<hi rend="bold">,</hi>@e<hi rend="bold">,</hi>@f<hi rend="bold">,</hi>@g<hi rend="bold">,</hi>@a<hi rend="bold">and</hi>@b<hi rend="italic">* attributes, which affect the corresponding strings of the harp. All of these attributes may take the values "</hi>f<hi rend="italic">" (flat), "</hi>s<hi rend="italic">" (sharp) or "</hi>n*" (natural), where "n" is the default value, which is assumed when one of these attributes is not specified. <figure>

   </figure>  In the first diagram of the preceding example, the B, and E pedals are in the flat position, while the C pedal is in sharp position. The other, non-specified pedals are in the natural position.</p>
