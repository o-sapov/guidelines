<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In production, it is best to use a customized version of MEI, restricted to the very needs of a project. Such a custom schema will guide the encoders and will help to ensure consistency and data quality throughout a project's files. A customization typically provides a subset of MEI's encoding models (typically starting from one of the official<hi rend="italic">profiles</hi>mentioned in chapter <ptr target="meiprofiles"/>), with only one solution for any given situation being allowed. The customization will help to reflect the scope of a project into its data: Only those aspects of music notation a project is interested in will be allowed, so that the absence of a specific information can not be misunderstood as an oversight of the encoders. Larger editorial projects like<hi rend="italic">Complete Works</hi>editions typically use<hi rend="italic">Editorial Guidelines</hi>(german:<hi rend="italic">Editionsrichtlinien</hi>) for the same purposes: (internal) quality control and (external) documentation. In that sense, MEI customizations may serve as Editorial Guidelines in digital form. MEI is implemented in ODD. ODD, or<hi rend="italic">One Document Does-it-all</hi>, is another XML-based markup language developed and maintained by the TEI. TEI's documentation for ODD can be found in the TEI Guidelines chapter 22:<a xmlns=""
      href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TD.html"
      title="">Documentation Elements</a>{:target='_blank'}, chapter 23:<a xmlns=""
      href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/USE.html"
      title="">Using the TEI</a>{:target='_blank'}, and the "<a xmlns=""
      href="https://tei-c.org/guidelines/customization/getting-started-with-p5-odds/"
      title="">Getting Started with P5 ODDs</a>{:target='_blank'}" document. At this point, there is no specific documentation on how to customize MEI with ODD beyond the generic TEI documentation. However, the provided <ptr target="meiprofiles"/> are based on ODD customizations, and may serve as starting point for further project-specific restrictions. They can be found at<a xmlns=""
      href="https://github.com/music-encoding/music-encoding/tree/develop/customizations"
      title="">https://github.com/music-encoding/music-encoding/tree/develop/customizations</a>{:target='_blank'}. In addition, several projects have shared their customizations on GitHub, such as<a xmlns=""
      href="https://github.com/Freischuetz-Digital/data-music/tree/master/schemata/odd"
      title="">Freisch√ºtz Digital</a>{:target='_blank'} or<a xmlns=""
      href="https://github.com/BeethovensWerkstatt/module2/tree/dev/data/odd"
      title="">Beethovens Werkstatt</a>{:target='_blank'}. MEI provides a webservice at<a xmlns="" href="http://custom.music-encoding.org/" title="">http://custom.music-encoding.org</a>{:target='_blank'} which allows to compile such customizations against the MEI sources in order to generate RelaxNG schemata, which can be used for validation. More documentation on customizing MEI will be provided as time permits; until then, it is recommended to<a xmlns=""
      href="https://music-encoding.org/community/community-contacts.html"
      title="">reach out to the MEI Community</a>{:target='_blank'} for additional assistance.</p>
