<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In opposition to regular imperfection, which is caused by a note of the next smaller degree (e.g., a perfect<hi rend="italic">brevis</hi>imperfected by a following/preceding<hi rend="italic">semibrevis</hi>), partial imperfection is caused by a note of two or even three orders apart. As an example, consider an imperfect<hi rend="italic">longa</hi>made up of two perfect<hi rend="italic">breves</hi>. This<hi rend="italic">longa</hi>can be "partially imperfected" by a following/preceding<hi rend="italic">semibrevis</hi>. This<hi rend="italic">semibrevis</hi>causes part of the<hi rend="italic">longa</hi>—one of its perfect<hi rend="italic">breves</hi>—to be imperfected, taking away one-third of one of its two halves. In this case, the<hi rend="italic">longa</hi>'s value changes from 6<hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi>(two perfect<hi rend="italic">breves</hi>) into 5<hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi>. Partial imperfection is not supported by the<hi rend="bold">@dur.quality</hi>attribute—because there can be many cases of partial imperfection, as will be seen in the following examples. To encode a partial imperfection, the<hi rend="bold">@num</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@numbase</hi>pair of attributes are used instead. Given the change in the<hi rend="italic">longa</hi>'s value from 6<hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi>to 5<hi rend="italic">semibreves</hi>, the corresponding attributes to encode this particular case of partial imperfection would be<hi rend="italic">num="6"</hi>and<hi rend="italic">numbase="5"</hi>as shown below in the code snippet and its rendering.  Partial imperfection can also happen from both sides of a note at once, as shown below:  An example of partial imperfection caused by a note three orders apart is given next. Here the<hi rend="italic">longa</hi>is partially imperfected by a<hi rend="italic">minima</hi>(instead of by a<hi rend="italic">semibrevis</hi>).  In the next example, the<hi rend="italic">longa</hi>is also imperfected by a<hi rend="italic">minima</hi>. However, the<hi rend="bold">@num</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@numbase</hi>ratio is different from the example above because the default value of the<hi rend="italic">longa</hi>here (18<hi rend="italic">minimas</hi>) is different from that of the previous example (12<hi rend="italic">minimas</hi>). </p>
