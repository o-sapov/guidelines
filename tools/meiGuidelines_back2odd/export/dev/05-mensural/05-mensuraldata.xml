<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The data organization based on <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> elements that usually prevails in MEI is not appropriate for mensural notation because most music until 1600 does not have measures (bars) as we understand them today. Even though it is not defined by the mensural module, a more suitable alternate data organization without measures is available: <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> elements may occur directly within the <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> element without being organized into measures first. The organization of events (notes, rests, etc.) within the <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> elements remains unchanged.  This feature may also be used to encode measured music without using the <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> element. That is, the same data organization described above may be used, but with the addition of barlines, indicated by the <gi scheme="MEI">barLine</gi> element, for those situations where a measure-by-measure organization is not appropriate, for example, when measures are not coincident in all the staves of a score.</p>
