<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The usersymbols module does not currently support continuous composite lines or filled areas. As mentioned above, the rendition of lines is highly implementation dependent. Coordinate system transforms are restricted to scaling using<hi rend="bold">@scale</hi>.</p>
