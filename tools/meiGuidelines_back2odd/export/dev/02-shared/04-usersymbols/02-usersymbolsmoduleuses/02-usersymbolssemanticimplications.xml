<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The graphics primitives and symbols can be used directly in the music to describe text and lines on a purely graphical level, without implying a specific logical meaning. If possible, however, more meaningful elements should be used. This means for example, "a tempo" or "da capo" should in general not be put inside <gi scheme="MEI">anchoredText</gi>. Instead, <gi scheme="MEI">tempo</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">dir</gi> should be used. Likewise, slurs and ties should be encoded using their respective elements, not using <gi scheme="MEI">curve</gi>, and for glissandi, <gi scheme="MEI">gliss</gi> should be used instead of <gi scheme="MEI">line</gi>. An example usage for <gi scheme="MEI">line</gi> is the visualization of voice leading, which is not covered by a specific MEI element. <figure>
