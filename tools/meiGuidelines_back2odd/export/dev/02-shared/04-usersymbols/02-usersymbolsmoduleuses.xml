<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The elements provided by the usersymbols module may be used in two ways: 1. For defining lines, curves and text elements that cannot be represented by a more specific element. 2. For defining reusable symbols and special graphical renditions. For this purpose, it provides three elements as graphic primitives, <gi scheme="MEI">line</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">curve</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">anchoredText</gi>. Anywhere these elements are allowed, the <gi scheme="MEI">symbol</gi> element can be used as well. The <gi scheme="MEI">symbol</gi> element facilitates the re-use of symbols that were defined by <gi scheme="MEI">symbolDef</gi> elements.</p>
