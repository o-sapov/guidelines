<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The following elements are provided for the capture of scores and parts: <specList>
      <specDesc key="score"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="parts"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>

   <specList>
      <specDesc key="keyAccid"/>
   </specList> The character of elements specifying one or more score or staff parameters, such as meter and key signature, clefs, etc., is that of a milestone; that is, they affect all subsequent material until a following redefinition. A <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> element, which may affect more than just one staff, is allowed only within <gi scheme="MEI">score</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> elements, whereas <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> is allowed only within <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi>. A <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> nested inside a <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> must bear the same value for its<hi rend="bold">@n</hi>attribute as its parent staff and may thus not affect other staves. The actual use of these elements depends on the repertoire and historical context of the source material. For details on their use in Common Western Notation, please refer to chapter <ptr target="cmnDefs"/>.</p>
