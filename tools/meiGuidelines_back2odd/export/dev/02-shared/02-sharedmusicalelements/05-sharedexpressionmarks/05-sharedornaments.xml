<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Ornaments are formulae of embellishment that can be realized by adding supplementary notes to one or more notes of the melody. <specList>
      <specDesc key="ornam"/>
   </specList> MEI provides a generic element for encoding an ornament symbol that is not a mordent, turn, or trill. For those common CMN ornaments, please refer to <ptr target="cmnOrnaments"/>. Ornaments can be represented as textual strings (e.g. with a Unicode symbol) or with a user defined symbol. Ornaments can be control elements. That is, they be can linked via their attributes to other events. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting point attribute with either<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>or<hi rend="bold">@startid</hi>.</p>
