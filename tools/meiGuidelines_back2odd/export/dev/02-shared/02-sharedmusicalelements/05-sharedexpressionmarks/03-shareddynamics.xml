<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Dynamics, or dynamic marks, are terms, abbreviations, and symbols that indicate the specific degrees of volume of a note, phrase, or section of music, e.g., "piano", "forte". Transitions from one volume level to another, e.g., "crescendo", "diminuendo", are also specified through dynamic marks. <specList>
