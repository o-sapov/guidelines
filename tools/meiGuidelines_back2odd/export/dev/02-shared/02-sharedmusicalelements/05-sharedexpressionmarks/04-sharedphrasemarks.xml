<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Phrase marks are curved lines placed over or under notes to delineate short sections of a work that represent a unified melodic idea, analogous to a phrase in literature. <specList>
      <specDesc key="phrase"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="slur"/>
   </specList> MEI maintains a distinction between phrase marks and slurs, the latter being curved lines over or under a sequence of notes indicating they are to be performed using a particular playing/singing technique, notes that should be taken in a single breath by wind instruments or played by string instruments using a single stroke of the bow. Often, a slur also indicates that the affected notes should be played in a<hi rend="italic">legato</hi>manner. Even so, it is common for both of these concepts to be referred to generically as "slurs". Therefore, unless one is encoding music from a repertoire in which this distinction is important, the <gi scheme="MEI">slur</gi> element should be preferred over <gi scheme="MEI">phrase</gi>.</p>
