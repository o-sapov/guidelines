<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">All of the following elements can be considered text directives; however, MEI uses the <gi scheme="MEI">dir</gi> element specifically for words, abbreviations, numbers, or symbols specifying or suggesting the manner of performance that are not encoded elsewhere using the more specific elements of <gi scheme="MEI">tempo</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">dynam</gi>. <specList>
      <specDesc key="dir"/>
   </specList> Examples of directives include text strings such as 'affettuoso', fingering numbers, or music symbols such as segno and coda symbols or fermatas over a bar line. Directives can be control elements. That is, they can linked via their attributes to other events. The starting point of the directive may be indicated by either a tstamp, tstamp.ges, tstamp.real or startid attribute, while the ending point may be recorded by either a tstamp2, dur, dur.ges or endid attribute. It is a semantic error not to specify a starting point attribute.</p>
