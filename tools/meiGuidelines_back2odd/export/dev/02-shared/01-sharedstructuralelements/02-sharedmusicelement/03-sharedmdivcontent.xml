<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi scheme="MEI">mdiv</gi> element may contain one or both of two possible views: score and parts. <specList>
      <specDesc key="score"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="parts"/>
   </specList> The <gi scheme="MEI">score</gi> element represents notation in which all the parts of an ensemble are arranged on vertically aligned staves, while the <gi scheme="MEI">parts</gi> element collects the individually notated parts for each performer or group of performers. The explicit encoding of these two ‘views’ is necessary because it is not always possible or desirable to automatically derive one view from the other. In addition, separating scores and parts can eliminate a great deal of markup complexity.  The <gi scheme="MEI">score</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">parts</gi> elements may also be employed to accommodate different methods of organizing the markup – with no particular presentation implied. In this case, software may render a collection of parts as a score or a score as a collection of parts. Within the collective <gi scheme="MEI">parts</gi> element, notation for a single performer is represented by the <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> element: <specList>
      <specDesc key="part"/>
   </specList> A <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> is effectively a small-scale score, allowing all the encoding features of a full score, such as multiple staves, performance directives, and so on. A group of <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> element is useful for encoding performing parts when there is no score, such as in early music part books; when the parts have non-aligning bar lines; when different layout features, such as page turns, are needed for the score and parts; or for accommodating software that requires part-by-part encoding. Please note that <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> elements in MEI are not an indication of voice leading or staff grouping. Voice leading can be encoded using the<hi rend="bold">@next</hi>attribute, available on all the members of the <ident type="class">model.eventLike</ident> class. The <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi> element handles grouping of staves in the score context.  In both score and part views, the <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> element is used to describe logical characteristics of the encoded music, such as key signature, the sounding key (as opposed to the notated key signature), meter, etc., and visual features, such as page size, staff groupings and display labels, etc. The <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi> elements within <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi> and the order of <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> elements inside <gi scheme="MEI">staffGrp</gi> should follow the score order of the source for the encoding. A <gi scheme="MEI">part</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">score</gi> may be further divided into linear segments called "sections". <specList>
      <specDesc key="section"/>
   </specList>
   <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> elements are often used as a scoping mechanism for clef signs, key and meter signatures, as well as metronome, tempo, and expression markings. Using <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> elements can help to minimize the need for backward scanning to establish context when the starting point for access is not at the beginning of the score. <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> elements may also be used for other user-defined, i.e., analytical or editorial, purposes and may therefore be arbitrarily nested to any desired level. The <gi scheme="MEI">ending</gi> element shares the same model as the <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> element. Unlike <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi>, however, it may not be recursively nested. <specList>
      <specDesc key="ending"/>
   </specList> The most common (non-analytical, non-editorial) use of <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">ending</gi> elements is illustrated below:  Within <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi> elements, several methods of organization are possible, depending upon the notational style of the source material and the encoder's needs. For example, when the MEI.cmn module is used, the default organization is measure-by-measure, with <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> sub-elements within each <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>. Further discussion of CMN notation is continued in chapter <ptr target="cmn"/>. However, staff-by-staff organization is more appropriate for music without measures and is provided when either the MEI.mensural or MEI.neumes module is employed. Coverage of mensural notation is provided in chapter <ptr target="mensural"/>, while <ptr target="neumes"/> describes neumatic notation. It must be noted that, when both the MEI.cmn and MEI.mensural modules are available, it is possible to encode CMN notation without using <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> elements; that is, staff-by-staff organization may be used and the ends of measures marked using <gi scheme="MEI">barLine</gi> elements. In certain circumstances, this approach may be preferable for reproduction of the visual layout of the music. However, the simultaneous use of the <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">barLine</gi> elements may lead to confusion and should be avoided. Typically, MEI follows the order of sections as they appear in the document being encoded. When performance requires a different order, for instance in the case of D.C. and D.S. directives, the following element may be used to define the performance order. <specList>
      <specDesc key="expansion"/>
   </specList> In the following example, <gi scheme="MEI">expansion</gi> is used to indicate how the notated sections should be ordered in a "through-composed" rendition, for example for machine performance or analysis. The plist attribute contains an ordered list of identifiers of descendant <gi scheme="MEI">section</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">ending</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi>, or <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> elements. The sequence of values in the plist attribute indicates that the section labelled 'A' comes first, then the section labelled 'B', followed by the 'A' section again. This mechanism must be specified independently of any textual directives, such as "Da capo" or "D.S. al Fine", that may be present in the document. </p>
