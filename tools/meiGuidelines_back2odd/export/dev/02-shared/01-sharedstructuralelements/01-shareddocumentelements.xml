<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Typically, the following elements are available for the representation of the outermost structure of an MEI document: <specList>
      <specDesc key="mei"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="att.meiVersion" atts="meiversion"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="meiCorpus"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="meiHead"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="music"/>
   </specList> A typical MEI document contains an <gi scheme="MEI">mei</gi> element, which in turn contains metadata, represented by an <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> element, and the musical text itself, represented by a <gi scheme="MEI">music</gi> element. The <gi scheme="MEI">meiHead</gi> element, formally declared in the MEI.header module, is described in chapter <ptr target="headerstructure"/>. Other variations on this basic form are also available for the representation of: - a collection of related MEI-encoded texts, each with its own metadata, known as a corpus; - a document that contains only metadata, known as an independent or stand-alone header; - music notation markup without metadata, typically intended to be embedded within another kind of markup, such as TEI. Further information regarding the organization and encoding of music corpora is given in chapter <ptr target="corpus"/>. Stand-alone headers are more fully described in chapter <ptr target="headerIndependentHeader"/>. Inclusion of MEI encodings (partial or complete) inside Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) documents is covered in the TEI Guidelines at<a xmlns=""
