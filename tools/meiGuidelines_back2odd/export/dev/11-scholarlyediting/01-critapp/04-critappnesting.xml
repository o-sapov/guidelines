<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In some situations, musical sources will agree at one level while differing at a lower level. For these cases, <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> elements may be nested to any level necessary. In the following example, there are three sources, two of which agree on the addition of a measure, but differ in the content of the added measure:  When nesting <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> elements, it is important that the value(s) in the child <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> element's<hi rend="bold">@source</hi>attribute must be a strict subset of the ancestor <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> element's<hi rend="bold">@source</hi>value.</p>
