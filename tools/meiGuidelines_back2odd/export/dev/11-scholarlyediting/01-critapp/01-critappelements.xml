<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The following elements are defined in the critApp Module: <specList>
      <specDesc key="app"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="lem"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="rdg"/>
   </specList> An <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> element always encapsulates the differences between varying sources. Therefore, it must contain at least two child elements. Possible child elements are <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi>, which use the same model, but have a different meaning: Whereas <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi> is used for prioritizing one alternative, a <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> has no such additional meaning and simply indicates a reading as found in one or more sources. Accordingly, <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi> is allowed only once in <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi>, whereas <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> may appear as often as necessary.  The <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> (and <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi>) elements use the<hi rend="bold">@source</hi>attribute to point to one or more descriptions of the bibliographic sources containing the material they mark:   The<hi rend="bold">@seq</hi>attribute may be used on <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> to record the sequence of a series of readings. In the following example, the material in source B is marked as sequential to (and perhaps derived from) the reading in source A:  If interested in modeling such dependencies between witnesses, using markup from <ptr target="FRBR"/> is generally recommendable. If a source has additional content that is not found in other sources, an empty <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> element may be used to indicate the lack of material in the other sources. In the following example, source 1 includes material that is not found in sources 2 and 3:  When working with a large number of sources, it might seem tedious to provide references for all sources. However, use of the <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> element without<hi rend="bold">@source</hi>is not recommended because such an encoding is not explicit and is therefore difficult to process.</p>
