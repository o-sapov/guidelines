<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> element may be used to accommodate textual variation at nearly any point in a musical text. For example, it may be used to indicate minor differences such as stem directions:  or to indicate more significant differences, such as the insertion of extra measures:  However, the flexibility in the location of <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> places a burden on the encoder to ensure that the <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi>, and <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi> elements are used correctly; that is, the content of every <gi scheme="MEI">rdg</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">lem</gi> has to be a valid replacement for its parent <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi>, even though this cannot be controlled effectively by the MEI schema.</p>
