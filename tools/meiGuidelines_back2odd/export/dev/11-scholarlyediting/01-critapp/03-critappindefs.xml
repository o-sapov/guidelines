<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In addition to its use for differentiation of the musical content of multiple sources, <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> may also be utilized to describe the layout of different scores, even when the musical content itself remains the same. An example of this is two sources that have the same content, but a different ordering of staves on which the content is written. By definition, the order of staves in MEI is described in and derived from the order of <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> elements in <gi scheme="MEI">scoreDef</gi>, not from the order of <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> elements within a <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>. The <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> element in a measure points to its corresponding <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> using the same value for<hi rend="bold">@n</hi>on both elements. This rather loose mechanism makes it possible to point dynamically to the correct staff definition for a given source. The following example demonstrates how this can be accomplished for two sources, both presenting a two-staff score, but with differing staff order. No further <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> element is necessary within the <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi> to describe the alternative score order of the sources.  When unique values for<hi rend="bold">@n</hi>on <gi scheme="MEI">layerDef</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi> are provided, it is possible to reallocate layers in the same fashion as staves. This mechanism may also be used to describe not only differing page orientations, formats and margins, but also clefs and keys. The use of <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi> in conjunction with <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> illustrates the greater flexibility of connecting <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi> by a shared<hi rend="bold">@n</hi>value. A technically more robust alternative to<hi rend="bold">@n</hi>would be to use the<hi rend="bold">@def</hi>attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi>, which points to the<hi rend="bold">@xml:id</hi>of a <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi>. However, this strong connection would be tied to one specific <gi scheme="MEI">staffDef</gi>, and would not allow to pick one alternative out of an <gi scheme="MEI">app</gi>.</p>
