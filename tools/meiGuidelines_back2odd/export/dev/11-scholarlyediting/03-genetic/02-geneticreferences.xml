<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">While the (relative) chronology of genetic states may be encoded using the <gi scheme="MEI">genDesc</gi> element (see <ptr target="geneticStates"/>), the textual operations they manifest in are encoded using the regular <gi scheme="MEI">add</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">del</gi>, etc. elements are used (see <ptr target="edittransAddDelOmissions"/>). However, for a genetic edition these elements are linked to their corresponding <gi scheme="MEI">genState</gi> element using the<hi rend="bold">@state</hi>attribute.  In the example above, state X of the encoded work is established by the change from a C clef to a G clef. Other states preceding state X will read a C clef, while state X and succeeding states read a G clef. A genetic state of the work is constituted by performing all textual operations referencing that state, i.e. by carrying out all additions, deletions and restorations. The<hi rend="bold">@instant</hi>attribute on <gi scheme="MEI">del</gi> etc. allows to specify that corresponding modification has been carried out immediately after writing the original text, so that no separate genetic state has been established. It is up to encoder to identify the appropriate level of granularity: In an ideal world, the writing or cancellation of a single note would constitute a new state. In practice, this level of detail isn't feasible, and the combination of multiple writing operations into larger logical operations seems inevitable. However, this may range from very large tasks (‘replacing the second movement of a symphony’) to very small ones (‘adding the slurs for the viola in measures 22 and 23’), depending on the intentions and scope of the encoding.</p>
