<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In genetic editions, it may also be of interest to trace when pages are added and / or removed from manuscripts. The general information about pages can be encoded using the <gi scheme="MEI">foliaDesc</gi> element, as described in <ptr target="foliadesc"/>. It is possible to wrap the elements used there, including <gi scheme="MEI">patch</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">cutout</gi> with editorial markup like <gi scheme="MEI">add</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">del</gi>. These elements can then be used to reference <gi scheme="MEI">genState</gi> as described in <ptr target="geneticReferences"/>.</p>
