<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Many musical scores make use of various kinds of shorthand notation which omit some parts of the score that have already been written elsewhere. Typical examples for this are symbols that indicate repetition of the preceding measure or beat. In MEI, these symbols can be encoded using the <gi scheme="MEI">mRpt</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">beatRpt</gi> elements respectively. Often, similar graphical symbols (often one or two slashes, "//") are used to mean that the current staff should have the same or similar content as another staff.<hi rend="italic">colla parte</hi>directives have a less strictly-defined scope than the ‘Rpt elements’ (<gi scheme="MEI">beatRpt</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">halfmRpt</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">mRpt</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">mRpt2</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">multiRpt</gi>). That is, rather than specifying the repetition of content of a particular duration, like a measure or beat,<hi rend="italic">colla parte</hi>instructions can refer to material of any length. In order to encode such scribal shorthand, MEI offers the <gi scheme="MEI">cpMark</gi> element, which allows filling of blank spaces in the score with horizontally and/or vertically distant material. <specList>
      <specDesc key="cpMark"/>
   </specList> Like any other ‘controlEvent’ (see <ptr target="eventsControlevents"/>), <gi scheme="MEI">cpMark</gi> is placed in the score using the<hi rend="bold">@staff</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>attributes. The end point of the mark itself, when necessary, may be indicated using the<hi rend="bold">@tstamp2</hi>attribute. The source material, which is intended to be inserted in the space indicated by the copy mark, can be identified by the attributes<hi rend="bold">@origin.tstamp</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@origin.tstamp2</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@origin.staff</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@origin.layer</hi>. While<hi rend="bold">@origin.tstamp</hi>provides the relative distance from the beginning of the "gap",<hi rend="bold">@origin.tstamp</hi>is relative to the position identified by<hi rend="bold">@origin.tstamp</hi>. However,<hi rend="bold">@origin.tstamp</hi>defaults to the same value as<hi rend="bold">@tstamp2</hi>and should only be provided when necessary. When neither<hi rend="bold">@origin.staff</hi>nor<hi rend="bold">@origin.tstamp</hi>are provided, they take the same values as the cpMark's<hi rend="bold">@staff</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>attributes; that is, they indicate a strict ‘vertical’ or ‘horizontal’ copy. <figure>

   </figure> In the example above, there are no less than three different copy instructions, which need to be encoded with four <gi scheme="MEI">cpMark</gi> elements. First, Weber inserts characters from "a" to "f" in red ink to identify filled measures. Then, he repeats the same characters in *empty* measures, which indicates that the content from the<hi rend="italic">filled</hi>measures should be copied here. While one could try to encode this with just one <gi scheme="MEI">cpMark</gi> element, it is both clearer and easier to process when using two elements. The second and third shorthand indications are written in the second violin (lower staff). Here, Weber writes "unis.[ono]", silently omitting the reference to the first violin. His next shorthand ("in 8va") additionally instructs the copyist to double the written material in another octave. This information can be captured using the<hi rend="bold">@dis</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@dis.place</hi>attributes on <gi scheme="MEI">cpMark</gi>.  <figure>

   </figure> Text used as a copy mark, like the letters in the Weber example, may be encoded as content of the <gi scheme="MEI">cpMark</gi> element. In the case of non-text marks, the **@altsym<hi rend="bold">and</hi>@facs** attributes may be used to refer to a graphical surrogate. Depending on the purpose of the encoding, the omitted parts in the score may be filled with <gi scheme="MEI">space</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">mSpace</gi> elements of appropriate duration or silently overwritten with the content that the <gi scheme="MEI">cpMark</gi> identifies. Also, these two options may be combined through the use a <gi scheme="MEI">choice</gi> element whose <gi scheme="MEI">abbr</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">expan</gi> children explicitly encode a transcription of the original ‘gap’ (in abbr) and the result of the insertion of the indicated material (in expan, see <ptr target="edittransAbbrev"/>).</p>
