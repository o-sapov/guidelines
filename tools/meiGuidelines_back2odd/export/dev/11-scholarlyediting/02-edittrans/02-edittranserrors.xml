<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">When the source material to be encoded is manifestly faulty, an encoder or transcriber may elect simply to correct it without comment, although for scholarly purposes it will often be more generally useful to record both the correction and the original state of the text. The elements described here enable all three approaches, and allows the last to be done in a way that makes it easy for software to present either the original or the correction. <specList>
      <specDesc key="sic"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="corr"/>
   </specList> The following examples show alternative treatment of the same material. The text to be encoded contains a chord (c4, e4, g4, a4), where c4, e4, and a4 are quarter notes, but g4 is incorrectly written as a half note. An encoder may choose to silently correct the engraver's error:  or the correction may be made explicit:  Alternatively, the encoder may simply record the typographic error without correcting it, either without comment or with a <gi scheme="MEI">sic</gi> element to indicate the error is not a transcription error in the encoding:  If the encoder elects to record the original source text and provide a correction for the sake of transparency, both <gi scheme="MEI">sic</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">corr</gi> may be used, wrapped in a <gi scheme="MEI">choice</gi> element. The order of the <gi scheme="MEI">sic</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">corr</gi> elements is not significant:  An indication of the person or agency responsible for the emendation can be provided as follows:  Here the<hi rend="bold">@resp</hi>attribute has been used to indicate responsibility for the correction. Its value (<hi rend="italic">#editTrans.JK</hi>) is an example of the pointer values discussed in section <ptr target="ptrRef"/>. In this case, the<hi rend="bold">@resp</hi>attribute points to a <gi scheme="MEI">name</gi> element within the metadata header, but any element might be indicated in this way, if the correction has been taken from some other source. The<hi rend="bold">@resp</hi>attribute is available for all elements which are members of the <ident type="class">att.common</ident> class (through <ident type="class">att.responsibility</ident>). The <ident type="class">att.edit</ident> class makes available a<hi rend="bold">@cert</hi>attribute (through <ident type="class">att.evidence</ident>), which may be used to indicate the degree of editorial confidence in a particular correction, as in the following example:  Where, as here, the correction takes the form of amending information present in the text being encoded, the encoder should use the <gi scheme="MEI">corr</gi> element. Where the correction is present in the text being encoded, and consists of some combination of visible additions and deletions, the elements <gi scheme="MEI">add</gi> and / or <gi scheme="MEI">del</gi> should be used. For additional information on the use of <gi scheme="MEI">add</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">del</gi>, see section <ptr target="edittransAddDel"/>. Where the correction takes the form of an addition of material not present in the original because of physical damage or illegibility, the <gi scheme="MEI">supplied</gi> element may be used. Where the ‘correction’ is simply a matter of expanding abbreviated notation, the <gi scheme="MEI">expan</gi> element may be used.</p>
