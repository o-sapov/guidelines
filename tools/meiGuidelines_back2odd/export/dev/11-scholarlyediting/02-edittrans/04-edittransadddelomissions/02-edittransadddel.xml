<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The <gi scheme="MEI">add</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">del</gi> elements may be used to record where material has been added or deleted in the source material. The following example demonstrates the usage of <gi scheme="MEI">add</gi> to mark up a note being added to an existing chord:  The next example shows how <gi scheme="MEI">del</gi> may be used to capture the information that two measures have been cancelled. As seen in this example, the<hi rend="bold">@rend</hi>attribute is used to specify the method of deletion.  Additional information for both elements may be specified using attributes. Whereas the<hi rend="bold">@hand</hi>attribute marks responsibility for the textual change, the<hi rend="bold">@resp</hi>attribute is used to refer to the editor who identified this textual change as such. The<hi rend="bold">@cert</hi>attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the identification of the hand of the deletion or addition. The <gi scheme="MEI">add</gi> element should not be used to mark editorial changes, such as supplying a note omitted by mistake from the source text or a passage present in another source. In these cases, either the <gi scheme="MEI">corr</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">supplied</gi> tags should be used instead.</p>
