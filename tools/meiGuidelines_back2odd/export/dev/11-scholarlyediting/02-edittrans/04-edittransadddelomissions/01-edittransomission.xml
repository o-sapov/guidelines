<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Encoders may choose to omit parts of the source for reasons ranging from illegibility, (making transcription difficult or impossible), to editorial policy, e.g., systematic exclusion of poetry or prose from an encoding. The full details of the policy decisions concerned should be documented in the MEI header (see section <ptr target="headerEncodingDescription"/>). Each place in the text at which omission has taken place should be marked with a <gi scheme="MEI">gap</gi> element, optionally with further information about the reason for the omission, its extent, and the person or agency responsible for it, as in the following examples:   Note that the extent of the gap may be marked precisely using attributes<hi rend="bold">@unit</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@extent</hi>. Unlike TEI, MEI does not offer a<hi rend="italic">desc</hi>element for further description of the reason for a gap. Instead, an <gi scheme="MEI">annot</gi> may refer to the gap via its<hi rend="bold">@startid</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@endid</hi>, or<hi rend="bold">@plist</hi>attributes and provide additional information. The <gi scheme="MEI">unclear</gi> element is used to mark passages in the original which cannot be read with confidence, or about which the transcriber is uncertain for other reasons, as for example when transcribing an illegible source. Its<hi rend="bold">@reason</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@resp</hi>attributes are used, as with the <gi scheme="MEI">gap</gi> element, to indicate the cause of uncertainty and the person responsible for the conjectured reading.  Where the difficulty in transcription arises from an identifiable cause, the<hi rend="bold">@agent</hi>attribute signifies the causative agent. The<hi rend="bold">@cert</hi>attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the transcription of the text contained within the <gi scheme="MEI">unclear</gi> element. Where the difficulty in transcription arises from action (partial deletion, etc.) assignable to an identifiable hand, the<hi rend="bold">@hand</hi>attribute may record the hand responsible for the action. When the reason for a gap in the encoding is damage of the document carrier (the paper on which the document is written, for example), the <gi scheme="MEI">damage</gi> element should be used instead of the <gi scheme="MEI">gap</gi> element. In the case of damage resulting from an identifiable cause, the<hi rend="bold">@agent</hi>attribute signifies the causative agent. The<hi rend="bold">@degree</hi>attribute signifies the degree of damage according to a convenient scale. A <gi scheme="MEI">damage</gi> tag with this attribute should only be used where the text may be read with some confidence; data supplied from other sources should be tagged as <gi scheme="MEI">supplied</gi>. The<hi rend="bold">@extent</hi>attribute indicates approximately how much text is in the damaged area, in notes, measures, inches, or any appropriate unit, where this cannot be deduced from the contents of the tag. For example, the damage may span structural divisions in the text so that the tag must then be empty of content. In the case of damage (deliberate defacement, etc.) assignable to an identifiable hand, the<hi rend="bold">@hand</hi>attribute signifies the hand responsible for the damage. Sometimes the editor provides information not present in the source material. These conjectures or emendations are marked up in MEI using the <gi scheme="MEI">supplied</gi> element. The following example demonstrates the use of the <gi scheme="MEI">supplied</gi> element in combination with <gi scheme="MEI">gap</gi> within <gi scheme="MEI">subst</gi>:  When the presumed loss of text arises from an identifiable cause,<hi rend="bold">@agent</hi>signifies the causative agent. When the presumed loss of text arises from action (partial deletion, etc.) assignable to an identifiable hand, the<hi rend="bold">@hand</hi>attribute signifies the hand responsible for the action. The<hi rend="bold">@reason</hi>attribute indicates why the text has to be supplied, e.g. 'overbinding', 'faded ink', 'lost folio', 'omitted in original', etc. The<hi rend="bold">@source</hi>attribute contains the source of the supplied text. The editor(s) responsible for supplied material may be recorded in the<hi rend="bold">@resp</hi>attribute. The value of<hi rend="bold">@resp</hi>must point to one or more identifiers declared in the document header. The<hi rend="bold">@cert</hi>attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the supplied material.</p>
