<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">When several interventions to the musical text are to be regarded as a single action, they may be grouped using the <gi scheme="MEI">subst</gi> element. The most common combination is a replacement of portions of the musical text using both the <gi scheme="MEI">add</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">del</gi> element, as seen in the following example:  An intervention closely related to substitution is the restoration of a previously deleted section. For this purpose MEI offers the <gi scheme="MEI">restore</gi> element, which may contain a <gi scheme="MEI">del</gi> or other content directly. The following example illustrates an instance where a lyric was cancelled and later restored by overwriting it:  The<hi rend="bold">@desc</hi>attribute gives a prose description of the means of restoration. The<hi rend="bold">@cert</hi>attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the identification of the hand of the restoration. The<hi rend="bold">@type</hi>attribute may be used to indicate the action cancelled by the restoration. The<hi rend="bold">@resp</hi>attribute contains an ID reference to an element containing the name of the editor or transcriber responsible for identifying the hand of the restoration. The<hi rend="bold">@hand</hi>attribute signifies the hand of the agent which made the restoration. MEI offers a <gi scheme="MEI">handShift</gi> milestone element that can be used to mark a change of scribe or scribal style. The<hi rend="bold">@character</hi>attribute describes characteristics of the hand, particularly those related to the quality of the writing, e.g., 'shaky', 'thick', regular'. A description of the tint or type of ink, e.g., 'brown' or the writing medium, e.g., 'pencil', may be placed in the<hi rend="bold">@medium</hi>attribute.  The new hand may be identified using the<hi rend="bold">@new</hi>attribute, while the previous hand may be recorded in the<hi rend="bold">@old</hi>attribute. The<hi rend="bold">@resp</hi>attribute contains an ID reference to an element containing the name of the editor or transcriber responsible for identifying the change of hand. The<hi rend="bold">@cert</hi>attribute signifies the degree of certainty ascribed to the identification of the new hand. When using this element within a layer, it is important to ensure that all layers and staves are considered. Every <gi scheme="MEI">handShift</gi> affects only the content of its own layer and staff, even in the following measures. Therefore, there must be a separate <gi scheme="MEI">handShift</gi> for every <gi scheme="MEI">staff</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">layer</gi>. This mechanism allows the description of shifts at timestamps that differ between each staff.</p>
