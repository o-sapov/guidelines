<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Solmization is a system which associates a syllable with each note of a musical scale. There are various forms of solmization used throughout the world. In Europe and North America, solfège is the most common practice. In this system, the seven syllables for a major scale are do, re, mi, fa, so, la and ti. In the ‘fixed-do’ system, the syllable "do" is always associated with the pitch "c", while in the ‘movable-do’ system, "do" is associated with the tonic note. The<hi rend="bold">@psolfa</hi>attribute is only allowed on <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi> and <gi scheme="MEI">nc</gi> elements. Its value is unconstrained in order to accommodate various solmization systems. </p>
