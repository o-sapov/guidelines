<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This chapter describes the use of attributes that capture data which may be useful for analytical purposes. The analysis module provides attributes that record relationships between entities found in the encoding. These attributes may be used differently by different users, depending on the purpose of the analysis. These Guidelines recommend that encoders employ commonly accepted analytical practices, such as ‘functional analysis’ or ‘Schenkerian analysis’, and document their use in the <gi scheme="MEI">encodingDesc</gi> described in section <ptr target="headerEncodingDescription"/>.
