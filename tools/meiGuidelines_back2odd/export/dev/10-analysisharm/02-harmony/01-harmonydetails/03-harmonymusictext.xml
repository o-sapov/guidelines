<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">With regard to indications of harmony, MEI attempts to strike a balance between very precise (interpreted) and very loose (uninterpreted) markup needs. Therefore, various kinds of harmonic labels are accommodated by the <gi scheme="MEI">harm</gi> element. While some are more structured than others, in the final analyis they all function as<hi rend="italic">labels</hi>. Therefore, MEI provides only a single element for the capture of harmonic indications of all kinds: <specList>
      <specDesc key="att.extender" atts="extender"/>
      <specDesc key="att.harm.vis" atts="rendgrid"/>
   </specList> The <gi scheme="MEI">harm</gi> element can be used to capture chord labels that consist entirely of text:  or labels that are chord tablature grids: {% include figure img="modules/harmony/A7<hi rend="italic">5th.gif" caption="Chord grid without label" %}  or labels that mix these styles: {% include figure img="modules/harmony/A7</hi>1st.gif" caption="Chord grid with label" %}  The <gi scheme="MEI">harm</gi> element must define a point of attachment using one of the following attributes:<hi rend="bold">@startid</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@tstamp.ges</hi>or<hi rend="bold">@tstamp.real</hi>. The most commonly-used of these are<hi rend="bold">@startid</hi>and<hi rend="bold">@tstamp</hi>. The<hi rend="bold">@dur</hi>attribute encodes the logical and visual duration of the harmony. Please note that the<hi rend="bold">@dur</hi>attribute here is not a true duration, but rather a time stamp for the end point of the harmony. Precise placement of the harmonic label can be controlled through the use of attributes in the <ident type="class">att.harm.vis</ident> attribute class.</p>
