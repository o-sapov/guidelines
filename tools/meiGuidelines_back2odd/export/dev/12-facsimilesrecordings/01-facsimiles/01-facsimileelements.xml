<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This module makes available the following elements for encoding facsimiles: <specList>
      <specDesc key="facsimile"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="surface"/>
   </specList>
   <specList>
      <specDesc key="zone"/>
   </specList> These element are used to add a separate subtree to MEI, starting with the <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi> element inside <gi scheme="MEI">music</gi>, as seen in the following example:  It is possible to have more than one <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi> element in this location. This is especially useful when multiple sources are encoded in the same file using the mechanisms described in chapter <ptr target="editTrans"/> of these Guidelines. In this case, the<hi rend="bold">@decls</hi>(declarations) attribute of <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi> may be used to refer to a source defined in the document's header, as seen in the following example:  When using the FRBR model (see <ptr target="FRBR"/>), it is equally possible to reference a <gi scheme="MEI">manifestation</gi> element instead of <gi scheme="MEI">source</gi>. Within a <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi> element, each page of the source is represented by a <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi> element. Each surface may be assigned an identifying string utilizing the<hi rend="bold">@label</hi>attribute. In addition, it may encapsulate more detailed metadata about itself in a <gi scheme="MEI">figDesc</gi> element. The coordinate space of the surface may be recorded in abstract terms in the<hi rend="bold">@ulx</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@uly</hi>,<hi rend="bold">@lrx</hi>, and<hi rend="bold">@lry</hi>attributes. For navigation purposes, <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi> has a<hi rend="bold">@startid</hi>attribute that accommodates pointing to the first object appearing on this particular writing surface.  Within <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi> elements, one may nest one or more <gi scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> elements, each providing a reference to an image file that represents the writing surface. Multiple <gi scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> elements are permitted in order to accommodate alternative versions (different resolutions or formats, for instance) of the surface image. In spite of changes in resolution or format, all images must contain the same content, i.e., the entire writing surface. A <gi scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> may refer to a single page within a multi-page document, which is – at least for Adobe PDF documents – available through a #page=X suffix to the<hi rend="bold">@target</hi>attribute.  The preceding markup will provide the basis for most page-turning applications. Often, however, it is desirable to focus attention on particular areas of the graphical representation of the surface. The <gi scheme="MEI">zone</gi> element fulfills this purpose:  The coordinates of each zone<hi rend="italic">define a space relative to the coordinate space of its parent surface</hi>. Note that this is not necessarily the same coordinate space defined by the width and height attributes of the graphic that represents the surface. The zone coordinates in the preceding example do not represent regions within the graphic, but rather regions of the<hi rend="italic">writing surface</hi>. Because the coordinate space of a zone is defined relative to that of a surface, it is possible to provide multiple graphic elements<hi rend="italic">and</hi>multiple zone elements within a single surface. In the following example, two different images representing the entire surface are provided alongside specification of two zones of interest within the surface:  A <gi scheme="MEI">zone</gi> element may contain <gi scheme="MEI">figDesc</gi> or <gi scheme="MEI">graphic</gi> elements that provide detailed descriptive information about the zone and additional images, e.g., at a different/higher resolution, of the rectangle defined by the zone. The data objects contained within the zone may also be specified through the use of the<hi rend="bold">@data</hi>attribute, which contains ID references to one more elements in the content tree of the MEI file, such as a <gi scheme="MEI">note</gi>, <gi scheme="MEI">measure</gi>, etc.  Conversely, an element in the content may refer to the <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi> subtree using its<hi rend="bold">@facs</hi>attribute, which is made available by the <ident type="class">att.facsimile</ident> attribute class. The last example could therefore be encoded with pointers in the other direction:  The <gi scheme="MEI">pb</gi> element defined in the <ptr target="shared"/> makes special use of the<hi rend="bold">@facs</hi>attribute, in that it does not point to a <gi scheme="MEI">zone</gi>, but a <gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi> element instead. A <gi scheme="MEI">pb</gi> marks the beginning of a page, so it can be concluded that all elements in the content tree which are encoded between any two <gi scheme="MEI">pb</gi> elements encode musical symbols written on the page (<gi scheme="MEI">surface</gi>) referenced by the first of these two <gi scheme="MEI">pb</gi> element's<hi rend="bold">@facs</hi>attribute. The encoding of <gi scheme="MEI">facsimile</gi> elements is intended to support sequential display of page images. If an encoder wants to describe the physical setup of a source document, the <gi scheme="MEI">foliaDesc</gi> element is more appropriate. The difference of both approaches, and how to combine them, is described in chapter <ptr target="foliadesc"/>.</p>
