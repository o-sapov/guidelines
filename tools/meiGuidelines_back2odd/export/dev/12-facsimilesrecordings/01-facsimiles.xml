<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Most often, MEI is used for the preparation of a digital musical text based on an existing music document, or with the intention of rendering the encoded notation into a document or audio rendition. MEI can, however, be used to provide a different kind of digital reproduction of a source document, which relies on the description and provision of digital imagery. Both approaches may be combined, so that the encoding of the musical content and digital facsimiles may add different facets to the same MEI document.</p>
